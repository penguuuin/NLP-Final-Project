 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 	 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? 	 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 How about drinking soda ? 	 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . 
 And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 	 I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .

 How do you like them ? 	 Not bad . 
 Then , why didn't you do that ? 	 I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? 
 I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? 	 Some of them , I think , are not good . 
 It doesn't taste good ? 	 No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . 
 That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? 	 I judge by appearances . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 	 Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . 
 You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 	 Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
 Sounds good . May I have a look ? 	 Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . 
 Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? 	 This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .

 Would you please show me that mural ? 	 Certainly . Here you are .

 How did you finally do it ? 	 A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . 
 Like snacking ? 	 You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... 
 What have you learned ? 	 Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . 
 As opposed to short and shallow ? 	 Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' 
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? 	 I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? 
 I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? 	 Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . 
 That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? 	 We have half-hour and one-hour treatments .

 That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? 	 Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .

 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 	 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 Why ? 	 That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .

What is your favorite coffee ? 	 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 	 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 	 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .

 Where are you going ? 	 I'm going to Wangfujing . 
How much is the fare ? 	 Three yuan . 
 Could you tell me how to use it ? 	 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform .

May I try on this pair of shoes ? 	 Of course . What is your size ? 
 Of course . What is your size ? 	 I think it's 35 . 
 Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? 	 This is just right for me . I'll take this one .

What would you have ? 	 I'll try Chinese wine . 
May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ? 	 Tsingtao beer ? 
 Tsingtao beer ? 	 Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China .

 So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? 	 Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . 
 Do you do the same exercises every day ? 	 No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on .

 Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 	 It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too .

 What ? Are you serious ? 	 Yes . 
 That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? 	 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
What would you like for your main dish ? 	 Steak , please . 
 How would you like it ? 	 Medium rare , please . 
 Anything else , sir ? 	 May I have a glass of red wine , please ?

 With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? 	 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 
 Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 	 Does that make any difference ? 
 Does that make any difference ? 	 Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . 
 Are they designed differently ? 	 A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . 
 What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? 	 Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . 
 Faulty products ? 	 Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . 
 How many do you want to buy ? 	 I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? 
 I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? 	 You're right . 
 Do you often exercise ? 	 Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . 
 What style of swimming do you like best ? 	 I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . 
 I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? 	 Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . 
Welcome to Flash Foot , sir . How can I help you ? 	 I'd like extra prints made of these photos . 
 Do you have your negatives ? 	 Yes . Here they are . I've marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
 What size do you want the prints ? 	 Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . 
Welcome to Flash Foot . What can I do for you , ma'am ? 	 I'd like to have this roll of film developed . 
 What size prints would you like ? 	 Four by six will do . 
What is my ideal weight ? 	 It depends on your height and body type . 
 How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? 	 By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . 
 And now ? 	 Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . 
Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? 	 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? 	 No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . 
Have you any beef today ? 	 Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . 
 How much is it a pound ? 	 One pound and fifty pence a pound . 
Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? 	 What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy .

 How much is it in all ? 	 Thirty dollars . 
What is your policy on returns ? 	 If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . 
 That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? 	 Charge . Here's my card . 
You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? 	 110 pounds . 
 Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? 	 No , you know I can't bear eating less .

 How's it going on ? 	 You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . 
 Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? 	 Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ?

 Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? 	 This one is $ 500 . 
The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? 	 By credit card . 
 Do you take American Express ? 	 No , we don't . 
What'll it be today , sir ? 	 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 	 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 	 Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 	 Right here . 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 	 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 
May I help you ? 	 What's the price of the bread ?

 OK , what would you like ? 	 I'd like the lasagna , please . 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 	 I'll try the vegetarian , please . 
The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ? 	 Of course . 
 Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ? 	 I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch . 
Is this a duty-free shop ? 	 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 	 I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? 
 I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? 	 Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . 
 What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? 	 I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... 
How do you feel ? 	 I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . 
Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? 	 Give me a shot of whisky and soda . 
 With or without ice , sir ? 	 Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . 
 Cats chase mice , don't they ? 	 And bugs . They can catch anything . 
 Do you have to walk a cat ? 	 No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . 
Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? 	 Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer .

Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 	 Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . 
 Which bus do I have to change ? 	 You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . 
Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? 	 Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! 
 I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? 	 Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . 
 So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? 	 To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . 
 Like this ? 	 Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . 
 Did I do it right ? 	 No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . 
 What should I do with my legs then ? 	 Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . 
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? 	 Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . 
Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? 	 Sure . It's down this street on the left .

 How long will it take me to get there ? 	 It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . 
Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? 	 I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . 
 Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? 	 I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . 
 So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? 	 Indeed , you're exactly right ! 
Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? 	 Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . 
 Are you sure ? 	 Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . 
 Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? 	 It could also help you increase vital capacity . 
Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? 	 I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . 
How may I help you , miss ? 	 I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? 
 I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? 	 Would you like to have a perm ?

 Do you think it will suit me ? 	 Oh , absolutely . 
Would you do me a favor ? 	 I'd be glad to . What is it ? 
Hello . My name ’ s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? 	 Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . 
 What price range are you interested in ? 	 Well , between $ 350-400 a month . 
 Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? 	 I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . 
 When would you like to move in ? 	 As soon as possible . 
 How about the end of this month ? 	 Fine . 
 Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? 	 I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . 
 Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? 	 Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . 
Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 	 We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . 
 Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 	 Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 
Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? 	 You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service .

 Thank you . How much is it ? 	 25 yuan . 
 Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? 	 You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . 
What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 	 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 	 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 	 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 How about drinking soda ? 	 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . 
 That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 	 My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 How do you know so much about food and dieting ? 	 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 So , what do we do now ? 	 This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . 
 Can I pay you by check ? 	 Sure . A check will be fine . 
 Is there a laundry room in the basement ? 	 Yes . 
Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? 	 I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
 I am wondering if you do facial care ? 	 Yes , we do . 
 How much would it be ? 	 From 200 to 800 .

Good evening , madam . Can I help you ? 	 Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday . 
 Anything wrong with it ? 	 Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole . 
 Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ? 	 Here it is . 
Would you like a cigarette ? 	 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 	 That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 	 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 By the way , do you work out ? 	 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 
Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? 	 No.Why ? 
 No.Why ? 	 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . 
Excuse me , ma'am ? 	 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 	 I'm new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . 
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? 	 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 Aren't you tired ? 	 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? 	 It was okay . 
 Would you like a drink ? 	 No thanks , I'm not thirsty . 
 Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? 	 Not really . 
 Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? 	 Yes I did . 
 Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? 	 Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . 
I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? 	 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? 
 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? 	 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . 
 You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? 	 Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . 
 Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? 	 Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . 
 Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? 	 Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . 
 Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? 	 Yes , that would be good ! 
 We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? 	 If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . 
 You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? 	 Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . 
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 	 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? 	 Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . 
 What does that imply , then ? 	 More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . 
 How much are the roses ? 	 Twenty dollars per dozen . 
 Is there anything else you'd like to get ? 	 No , the roses will be fine . 
Overseas operator , may I help you ? 	 Yes . I would like to place a collect call . 
 Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 	 Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .

Why are there so many people ? 	 It seems like a traffic accident . 
Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 	 It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 	 I have a little white cat . 
 But I think they're dull , aren't they ? 	 Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? 	 Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 For example ? 	 People drive on the right in China . 
How can we avoid the jam ? 	 Let's take a roundabout way . 
How do you get road news ? 	 I've a driver mate in my car ! 
 So you have all the news on broadcast ? 	 Yes , it's so helpful . 
 What happened ? 	 The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . 
 What ’ s the time ? 	 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 	 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
How often does the bus run ? 	 Every five minutes . 
Why do you stop me ? 	 You have gone against the traffic rules . 
 Do you know this is a Onaway street ? 	 I don't know . 
How long do I have to wait ? 	 Two hours.That area is a little backward . 
Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 	 You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
 Why ? anything special there ? 	 It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
 Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 	 Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
 Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 	 Why not ? it's so cool . 
 Pardon ? 	 I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .

Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? 	 Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . 
 Have you ever seen such a nice house ? 	 Not really .

Hello , may I help you ? 	 Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 When do you want to move in ? 	 How about this afternoon ? 
 How about this afternoon ? 	 Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . 
 Is the place well-furnished ? 	 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 What about the kitchen ? 	 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , 
 Are the plumbing all right ? 	 The plumbing seems OK , too . 
Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 	 Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 	 Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 	 An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?

 What ? 	 I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . 
 Oh . Why did she do that ? 	 The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . 
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 	 No , I'm not clear . 
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? 	 I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . 
 What do you think is the biggest change ? 	 Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . 
 Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? 	 I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 
 How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? 	 Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . 
 I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? 	 They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .

 How would you decorate your house ? 	 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . 
 How many TVs would your dream home have ? 	 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 Why ? 	 Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . 
 Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? 	 Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants .

 This is perfect ! What do you think ? 	 I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! 
Steven , you are always looking in good shape . How do you keep it ? 	 I pay much attention to my daily diet . You know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease .

What's your apartment like ? 	 It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 What is it like living in on-campus housing ? 	 It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it .

 I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? 	 The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? 
 The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? 	 Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . 
 It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? 	 Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” 
 OK , do you want it urgently ? 	 Yeah , I really want it . I am on my uppers . 
Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 	 Yes , but it's quite a ways .

 And ? 	 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 And it's a brick ? 	 Yes . 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 	 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 	 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .

 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 	 Guess where we ended up .

 Why are you acting so strange today ? 	 I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding . 
Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? 	 Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . 
 Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? 	 Can you recommend some must-try ? 
 Can you recommend some must-try ? 	 OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . 
 I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ? 	 Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! 
 What did you do last weekend ? 	 It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano . 
 Did you play football with other children ? 	 Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you . 
The tea smells good . What tea is it ? 	 It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . 
 What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? 	 You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . 
 Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? 	 Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . 
 What's the advantage about tea ? 	 There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . 
 Does that mean the stronger the better ? 	 No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . 
 Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? 	 It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . 
 Why ? 	 It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . 
 I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 	 You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
 That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 	 Do you have any special request ? 
 Do you have any special request ? 	 I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
 So that means you are shopping for presents ? 	 Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . 
Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? 	 Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . 
 Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? 	 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Are there many things online ? 	 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! 
 Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? 	 Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . 
 Really ? How to do that ? 	 Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . 
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? 	 Let's click to check it out . 
 Are there any disadvantages about it ? 	 It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon . 
Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? 	 Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife .

 Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? 	 You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . 
 I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? 	 There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . 
 It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? 	 I'll take care of the order . 
 OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? 	 Don't forget about the dessert . 
Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? 	 I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . 
 I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? 	 Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . 
 Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? 	 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! 
 That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? 	 No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . 
Are you ready to order , sir ? 	 Yeah . I have a fancy for some wine tonight . Can you recommend something for me ?

 What would you like for appetizer and dinner ? 	 Croissant for appetizer and two beef steaks for dinner . 
 How do you want your steaks , rare , medium or well-done ? 	 Medium , please ? 
 Medium , please ? 	 Anything for dessert ? 
 Anything for dessert ? 	 Sure . We'd like to have Black Forest Cake for dessert . 
What can I do for you ? 	 I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . 
 I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ? 	 That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . 
 Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ? 	 Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . 
 Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? 	 I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 	 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 	 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 	 I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that . 
 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 	 Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . 
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 	 Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . 
 What about the performance itself ? 	 Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . 
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 	 The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . 
 You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? 	 They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
 Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ? 	 Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 
 Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ? 	 Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist . 
 Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 	 It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can . 
Can I help you , sir ? 	 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 	 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 	 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 	 Just a hunch , sir . 
 How much again ? 	 $ 59.95 . 
 Why not ? 	 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? 	 It's $ 60 here . 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 	 Of course not , sir . 
 Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? 	 Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . 
 Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? 	 He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . 
What can I do for you , young man ? 	 I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . 
 What sizes do you need ? 	 One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids . 
 Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? 	 Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . 
 OK . Anything else ? 	 Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . 
 My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? 	 Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . 
Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? 	 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? 	 Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . 
 I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? 	 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .

 He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ? 	 Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ... 
 You think it's better that he should be told ? 	 Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ? 	 This is not common noodles . They're “ long-lived ” noodles.it ' s an old Chinese tradition to eat.long - lived noodle on birthday . 
Want to send out for some Chinese ? 	 Some what ? 
 Some what ? 	 Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . 
 No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? 	 Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . 
 Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 	 Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . 
Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ? 	 I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot . 
 Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? 	 I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola . 
 Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? 	 The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? 
 The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? 	 Sure . Is it sweet ? 
 Sure . Is it sweet ? 	 Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too . 
What ? Your golden watch is lost ? 	 Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . 
 Are you serious ? How can that be ? 	 Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . 
 Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? 	 Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . 
Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? 	 Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . 
 Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? 	 Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . 
Tom , is Jenny crying ? 	 Can you take he away from me ? 
 Can you take he away from me ? 	 I ’ m just coming for that . 
 She ’ s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 	 But I am her brother , not her servant . 
Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 	 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
What can I do ? 	 The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . 
 Did you go to any illegal website ? 	 No , But does that matter ? 
 No , But does that matter ? 	 Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . 
 Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? 	 One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . 
 Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? 	 Of course . You'd better learn something about it . 
 I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? 	 Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? 
 Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? 	 Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that . 
What did the boss say ? 	 He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? 
 He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? 	 You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . 
 Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? 	 It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . 
 For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? 	 Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive .

 How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 	 There are four more stops . 
 Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 	 No , not on the train , but in the station .

 OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? 	 Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . 
 Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? 	 Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . 
 How much will it cost in that case ? 	 Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please .

 Honey , what's up ? 	 I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . 
 Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? 	 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 
 Did you panic at the time ? 	 A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . 
 Was there anyone else with you ? 	 Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . 
 So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? 	 Yes . I have to call the property management . 
 For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? 	 Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . 
Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 I said , I'm Ted , who are you ? 
 I said , I'm Ted , who are you ? 	 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Do you come here often , Laura ? 	 Huh ? I can't hear you , the music's too loud . 
 Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 	 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 	 I asked if you come here often . 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 	 No , this is my first time here . 
Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? 	 I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one . 
 Are you having any luck ? 	 Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them . 
 Do you mind if I go with you ? 	 Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
 What happened ? 	 I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . 
So what do you think of my new dress ? 	 I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . 
 Um , ninety-five dollars ? 	 Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 
 Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 	 I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
 Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? 	 I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 	 I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 I know several . But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 	 Isn't that complicated ? 
 Isn't that complicated ? 	 No , it's easy . We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 	 Sure . I love going to the mall . 
Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? 	 Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . 
 What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? 	 Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . 
 So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? 	 Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . 
Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? 	 No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 
 No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 	 You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 
 You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 	 No , Officer , not at all . 
 Then how can you explain your behavior ? 	 Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer . 
 Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? 	 Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . 
 On a cell phone ? 	 Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions .

Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? 	 I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . 
 Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? 	 Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . 
 So this would be your first automobile ? 	 That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . 
 Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? 	 Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .

 Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? 	 How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . 
 Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? 	 Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . 
 Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? 	 Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . 
 Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? 	 I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . 
 Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? 	 Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they .

Would you like to see our new shirts ? 	 Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . 
 Are they ? 	 Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see .

Are you going home now ? 	 No , I'm not . 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 	 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 An apartment ? Why ? 	 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Where are you living now ? 	 Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .

 Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ? 	 Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
 Right . What are you doing over there ? 	 I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! 
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 	 Promise you are not going to be angry ?

 What would you let me do now ? 	 You are free . You can go now .

 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 	 No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 
What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 	 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 	 I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .

Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 	 Yes , but it's quite a ways .

 How do I get there on foot ? 	 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 	 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 	 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
So can you fix it ? 	 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 	 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model .

 Great ! Can you set the table ? 	 Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast 
 What is that ? 	 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 	 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 	 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 	 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation !

 You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 	 It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? 
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 	 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 	 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? 	 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? 	 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? 	 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . 
 What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? 	 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . 
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? 	 Sorry . You know the rules . 
 Not even for an hour ? 	 Sorry , it ’ s impossible . 
I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 	 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Does he have a moustache or a beard ? 	 Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . 
 Sounds like Mike , is it ? 	 Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . 
 How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? 	 I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . 
Shall we have some soup first ? 	 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 	 Meat , I think . 
 Don't you like fish then ? 	 I do , but I want meat . 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 	 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 What would you like for dessert ? 	 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 	 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 	 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 	 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 
 Weight ? 	 I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 Any marks on his face ? 	 No , I don't think so . 
 Glasses ? 	 No . 
 what about his hair ? 	 Black or dark brown . 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 	 Straight , I think , and about average length . 
 Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ? 	 Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure .

 How about afternoon ? 	 Sounds not good . I won't take it . 
Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ? 	 No , I'll have the fish please . 
Excuse me , sir ? 	 Yes ? 
 Yes ? 	 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Why not ? 	 Can't you see the notes here ? 
 Can't you see the notes here ? 	 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . 
Are you going out again ? 	 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 	 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 Where it is ? 	 It's a private garden . 
 What sort of price are you asking ? 	 Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry . 
 Would it be convenient to see the room ? 	 Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch . 
Good morning . May I help you ? 	 Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms . 
 All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ? 	 My name's Donald Eakins . 
 E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ? 	 It's 1446 Pine Street . 
 1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ? 	 Yes , it is . 
Good morning ! May I help you ? 	 Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . 
 Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? 	 Furnished . 
 Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 	 No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . 
 My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ? 	 Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . 
Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ? 	 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 
 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 	 No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? 
 No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? 	 Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? 
 Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? 	 It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' 
 Why not ? 	 Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' . 
May I come in ? 	 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 What about the kitchen ? 	 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 	 Next Saturday at the earliest . 
 How do you want it , sir ? 	 Just take a little off on the top and shorten the back . But please don't make it too short . 
 How about your sideburns ? 	 Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too . 
 How much is it ? 	 Exactly five dollars . 
 Would you like a shampoo first ? 	 Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . 
 Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? 	 I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . 
 I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? 	 No problem . 
Good morning . Do I need an appointment ? 	 No , ma'am , there's only one person ahead of you . You won't have to wait long . 
 All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? 	 I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? 
 I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? 	 Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . 
 Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ? 	 Yes , if you think it will help . 
 What do you think of it ? 	 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 	 Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ?

 Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 	 Next Friday . 
 Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? 	 I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . 
 Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? 	 Certainly . 
 Yes , please wait a minute . I'll fetch it for you . Here it is . Please try it on and take a look at the mirror . How do you like it ? 	 Aren't the trousers a little too long ?

 Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? 	 OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... 
 Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? 	 Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . 
 How much ? 	 Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . 
 Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 	 That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? 
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? 	 The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . 
 That's another one thousand six hundred ? 	 Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . 
 OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ? 	 Great . See you then . 
So how long do you plan to live here ? 	 We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . 
 Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? 	 Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops . 
Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? 	 Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . 
 So what ? 	 It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ? 
 You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? 	 You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... 
 So what about the tennis racket ? 	 Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! 
 How much did that end up costing you ? 	 Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it ! 
So the apartment comes unfurnished ? 	 This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture . 
 And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? 	 Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . 
 It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? 	 We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . 
 It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? 	 With the shipping included--seventy dollars . 
 Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? 	 This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . 
 Blow my nose ? 	 Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . 
 Can't we go to McDonald's first ? 	 No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice . 
 Blah ... What's that ? 	 This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . 
 Why is that ? 	 Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . 
 And the downstairs neighbors ? 	 Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . 
 Chicken soup again ? 	 Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather . 
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? 	 I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . 
 And this kitchen is so clean . Did you help Johnny with that ? 	 I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes ! 
 That's great . And the garbage , too ? 	 Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . 
 Oh , great . Where was it ? 	 It fell out of the garbage bag . 
 What was it doing there ? 	 It was with all the other dishes from dinner . 
 You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? 	 I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . 
Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ? 	 Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? 
 Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? 	 No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ... 
 What time is it anyway ? 	 Nine-thirty . 
So can we play PlayStation later ? 	 Sure , if you're done ! 
 All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ? 	 Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ... 
So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? 	 It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . 
 I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? 	 There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . 
 What about veggies ? 	 They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . 
 Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? 	 I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! 
 You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? 	 I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! 
 Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? 	 Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . 
 Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? 	 OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . 
 Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? 	 That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . 
Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ? 	 Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . 
 Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? 	 Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 	 Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . 
 Sure , do you have the receipt ? 	 Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . 
 Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 	 The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . 
 I see , and what about the keyboard ? 	 I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . 
Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? 	 “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” 
 Trev , are you OK ? 	 Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! 
Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? 	 Sure ! What do you feel like having ? 
 Sure ! What do you feel like having ? 	 I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! 
 Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? 	 I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! 
 A what ? 	 A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 	 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 
Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? 	 Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? 
 Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? 	 Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? 
 Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? 	 Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! 
How much for these autographed Elvis records ? 	 Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks . 
 Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ? 	 Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . 
 You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ? 	 My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry . 
Why didn't you text me last night ? 	 What ? I sent you three or four messages ! 
 I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? 	 I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . 
Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ? 	 Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please . 
 Certainly sir , For which day and time please ? 	 Tonight at seven . 
 Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ? 	 Four people . 
 Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ? 	 Mark . 
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? 	 Almost , let me just put my apron on . 
 Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? 	 Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . 
 OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? 	 Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . 
 Done . So how long do we bake it for ? 	 We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . 
Hey honey ! Where were you ? 	 I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . 
 How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? 	 It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . 
What's for dinner ? 	 Leftovers . 
 What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? 	 From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! 
 Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? 	 Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . 
 Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? 	 Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . 
Welcome to Al's Bakery . What can I get you ? 	 Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread . 
 Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ? 	 No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ? 
 No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ? 	 We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ? 
 We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ? 	 Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ? 
 Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ? 	 We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes . 
 Will that be all ? 	 Yes . 
 Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? 	 He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . 
 What about here in physical education ? 	 He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . 
What did you cook ? 	 Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . 
 Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? 	 Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! 
 Want some more ? 	 I'm stuffed ! 
What are you doing this weekend ? 	 My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . 
 Is it a family thing or just friends ? 	 A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . 
 You mean your sister ? 	 No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . 
Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? 	 Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . 
 What about Rubella and Mumps ? 	 Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . 
 Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? 	 Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . 
 What ? Why ? 	 Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . 
Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? 	 Here you go . 
 Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? 	 We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . 
 What's my other option ? 	 Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . 
What's wrong ? 	 I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . 
 But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 	 The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . 
 OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? 	 Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . 
 Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? 	 No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . 
 I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? 	 Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . 
 Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? 	 That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . 
 All right . What varietal is that ? 	 Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . 
 And you think this is a good wine ? 	 Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . 
You want to go get a facial with me today ? 	 Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . 
 True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? 	 Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . 
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ? 	 I can't , I have to go to the gym . 
 That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? 	 Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats . 
 Are you looking for anything else ? 	 Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous . 
Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? 	 Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
 It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 	 Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . 
 Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? 	 Is fifteen dollars OK ? 
OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? 	 Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . 
 What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ? 	 I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle . 
 Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? 	 OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . 
 That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ? 	 No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . 
Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ? 	 He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ... 
 How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ? 	 She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 	 Black . Classic . 
 What size ? 	 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 	 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time . 
 How much are you selling it for ? 	 This t . v is only $ 2500 . 
 By how much ? 	 I'll buy it for $ 2000 . 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 	 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 What type of tools ? 	 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 	 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 
 What are you buying ? 	 I don't know what we need . 
 Okay , do we need any meat ? 	 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 	 What else do we need ? 
 What else do we need ? 	 Get some snack foods . 
What can I help you with today ? 	 My washing machine isn't working . 
 What's the problem ? 	 The water will not drain . 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 	 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 	 How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? 
 How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? 	 That would be perfect . 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 	 See you then . 
Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 	 Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ? 	 Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light . 
 How long does it take to get there ? 	 About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
 Will you take long ? 	 No ! Five minutes I promise ! 
Honey , can you set the table ? 	 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 	 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 	 Yeah , go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 	 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 	 Two thousand would be fine . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 	 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 	 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 	 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad . 
 Is that better ? 	 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 	 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 	 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 	 Well , I also have ... 
 Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 	 I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
 Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 	 We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 	 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 	 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 	 Not funny .

 Can you describe a mango to me ? 	 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it .

Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 	 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 	 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 	 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 I see . What else ? 	 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .

Excuse me . How much for one are these ? 	 Un .. Those are 25 dollars each . 
 OK . Say I was to buy four , could I get a discount ? 	 Well , I could offer you maybe 10 percent off .

Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? 	 It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 	 Not really , but they are on the rise . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ? 	 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! 
Hi , again . Can I get you some more fruit ? 	 Actually , I don't think I can eat another bite ! 
 You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ? 	 No , I didn't . Really ! 
Um , hello again . Are you sure you don't want to make a purchase , sir ? 	 I have a question . 
 Hush ... OK . What is it ? 	 Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ? 
 Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ? 	 What kind of question is that ? 
 What kind of question is that ? 	 I'm just curious . I think women are beautiful without this stuff . 
 Wow ! What's that ? 	 It's my new radio earphone . 
 What's that ? 	 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 
 What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ? 	 That piece fits on to your ear . It hooks right on . And you just put the other one in your other ear . 
So what did you get ? 	 It's all in the bag . 
 How is oil supposed to make you relax ? 	 They all have essence of flowers in them . 
 Cool ! They're big ! What have you got in there ? 	 Just the necessities 
 Are you planning a trip to the Outback ? 	 No , but you never know when you'll need a flashlight . 
 So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ? 	 Ha-ha ... I'm just fatigued . And tomorrow is a big day . 
 What's tomorrow ? 	 More sales ! 
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 	 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 Now what are you doing ? 	 Putting on mascara . 
What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ? 	 Yep . There's still so much to do ! 
 Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? 	 Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . 
 Oh , how high class ! So you just wear it forever ? 	 No . There's makeup remover for waterproof mascara . 
 Is it dry yet ? 	 Yep . See how long and curly my lashes are ? 
 Yep . See how long and curly my lashes are ? 	 They look fake . 
 I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ? 	 Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium ! 
 OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ? 	 All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted . 
Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ? 	 Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . 
What's in the box ? 	 Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... 
 What do you mean ? 	 It's a cute little teddy bear ! 
Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 	 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 	 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 	 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 	 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 Then after a few beers , you'll be singing in Taiwanese ? 	 Maybe ... 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 	 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 	 I'll have whatever you're having . 
 " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? 	 Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! 
Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? 	 Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! 
 It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 	 Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off . 
Taylor , you're looking a little pale . Are you sure you want to hand out nametags ? 	 Do I have a choice ? You said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show . 
Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ? 	 You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive ! 
 No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ? 	 Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky . 
 It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ? 	 Um ... we never were . We're just friends . 
 Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? 	 I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad . 
So , got any more ideas for the website ? 	 Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . 
 Any other ideas ? 	 We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . 
 Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? 	 No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! 
 Good for you . What items did you bid on ? 	 A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! 
But what if I don't win what I bid on ? 	 Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . 
 And people are honest ? 	 They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... 
 Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ? 	 Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . 
 And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 	 I didn't think there would be a problem . 
Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? 	 Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... 
 No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? 	 Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . 
 You're not coming ? 	 Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? 
 Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? 	 I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . 
 Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? 	 We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . 
How much are you planning to buy ? 	 Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! 
 Cool ! Can I come ? 	 No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... 
 But not enough space for me ? 	 Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... 
What in the world is that smell ? 	 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 	 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 	 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 
 So soon ? 	 You have to brew the grinds while they're fresh and drink it immediately for the best flavor . 
 You mean half-and-half ? 	 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 
This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 	 Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !

 They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ? 	 Are they from Taiwan ? 
 Are they from Taiwan ? 	 They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred . 
OK ... well , then how much is one jin ? 	 Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin . 
 30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ? 	 You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT . 
 This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ? 	 That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! 
 Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ? 	 Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! 
 And how about these little brown chips ? 	 Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 	 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 	 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ? 	 Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with . 
 So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ? 	 Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night . 
Isn't this fun ? 	 I have no idea what I'm doing .

 What should I do now ? 	 Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there . 
 So how can you stand the heat ? 	 Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little .

 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 	 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 	 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 I see . What else ? 	 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
what do we need to get from the supermarket ? 	 we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . 
 a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? 	 just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . 
 I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? 	 I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . 
 ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? 	 I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . 
Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 	 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now !

 Is that all , your majesty ? 	 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute .

 First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? 	 I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . 
 Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? 	 Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . 
 Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? 	 You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .

 But they aren't as light , right ? 	 That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . 
 Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? 	 No , but she exercises more than me . 
 Well , we can wait for the assistant to help us , or we can look through the boxes down here . What is your size ? 	 Here in America , it's six . 
It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ? 	 I've always got room for something sweet !

 Why not , sir ? 	 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 	 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 	 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 	 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . 
 I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? 	 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 	 Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . 
Why don't we get you some shirts ? 	 I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . 
 What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? 	 The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . 
 What instructions ? 	 We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . 
 Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? 	 Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . 
 Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? 	 The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . 
 Sawdust ? 	 Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on .

 And after the varnish ? 	 After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . 
 And then ? 	 Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . 
How can I help you ? 	 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Did you have anything specific in mind ? 	 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies .

What should I get Uncle Teddy ? 	 You could get him a tie . 
 Why not ? 	 Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . 
 How much do you want to spend ? 	 Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . 
 What should he have then ? 	 I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . 
 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? 	 I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . 
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? 	 She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . 
 Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? 	 How about the iguana ? 
 How about the iguana ? 	 I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .

 Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? 	 I was just kidding .

 I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? 	 Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . 
 Does he watch a lot of movies ? 	 Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . 
 May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? 	 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? 
 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? 	 It is very similar . The technology is the same . 
 Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? 	 For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . 
 But isn't it more expensive ? 	 It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . 
 What's that ? 	 If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . 
 And why not ? 	 Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . 
 Hmm . Is that true ? 	 Yes , it is , sir . 
 Well . And what about DVDs ? 	 This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot .

 What do you mean ? 	 Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
 So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 	 It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 	 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 Why ? 	 Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .

 I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? 	 Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . 
 What are those stores ? 	 They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . 
 Even silverware ? 	 Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . 
 I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? 	 I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . 
 What does that mean ? 	 That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . 
 Electronics ? 	 Yes . Like stereos and televisions . 
 How much is the membership fee ? 	 I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all

Morgan , can I ask you a question ? 	 sure , what is it ? 
 sure , what is it ? 	 I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . 
 what happen to all the leftover food ? 	 it usually goes to the dump . 
 that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? 	 ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today .

 the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? 	 I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? 
 I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? 	 unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? 
 unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? 	 I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? 
 I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? 	 maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . 
 maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? 	 you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup .

 how about the rice ? 	 I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 
 I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 	 white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! 
are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 	 yes . Which one is the brake again ? 
 yes . Which one is the brake again ? 	 the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 	 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ?

 Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 	 You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . 
 What's so great about it ? 	 What do you mean ? It's a scrim .

 brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? 	 haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black .

 Does that actually work for you ? 	 I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . 
 Why did you put it off until the last minute ? 	 I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . 
 Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? 	 We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . 
 And you think I fit the qualifications ? 	 Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . 
 Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? 	 Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . 
Hello , are you Chinese ? 	 No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? 
 No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? 	 I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?

 Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? 	 Yes , I can do that this afternoon . 
 Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? 	 Yes , let me put it on the calendar . 
 Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? 	 I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . 
 Congratulation . What will you do ? 	 They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese . 
Can I help you ? 	 Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . 
 Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? 	 Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . 
 What are those ? 	 They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . 
 Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? 	 Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . 
I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? 	 I don't know . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 	 Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here .

 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 	 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 How about the shelf ? 	 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 	 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 	 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 	 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 	 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 
Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? 	 Yes , Ms . Jones .

 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 	 I am 100 % certain . 
Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? 	 Yes , just once . 
 What was the reason ? 	 I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 	 I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . 
Hi ! Ed , what's up ? 	 Nothing . 
 What are you so ticked off about ? 	 I don't want to talk about it . 
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? 	 Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 
 Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 	 Yes . 
 What if I don't know the title of the book ? 	 Well , you can look under the author's name . 
 Could you give me an example ? 	 Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . 
 Really ? Can I join it ? 	 Of course you can if you like it . 
 How can I join it ? 	 There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . 
Is that Mr . Green ? 	 This is him speaking . 
Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? 	 Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? 
 Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? 	 Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? 
 Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? 	 A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . 
 How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? 	 Normally it can be completed in four years . 
Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 	 Don't brother me ! 
 So , what's the problem ? 	 I drew a blank on the algebra test . 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 	 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? 	 Really ? Why ? 
 Really ? Why ? 	 He had moved and held a party on July 1st . 
Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? 	 Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . 
 Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? 	 In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . 
Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? 	 I'm sick . I think I've got the flu . 
 What's the problem ? 	 I can't work out this problem . 
Is this the A housing office ? 	 Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? 
 Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? 	 I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . 
 Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ? 	 Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As . 
 Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ? 	 The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 	 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 	 Were I in your position , I'd go to America . 
 Which university should I apply to ? 	 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 
Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? 	 More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . 
 Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? 	 I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . 
 Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? 	 My dad was , but not my mom . 
How many credits are you taking this semester ? 	 I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . 
 What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? 	 Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . 
 If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? 	 I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . 
 Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? 	 As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . 
 It's ok . What do you want to ask ? 	 Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? 
 Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? 	 The first place you should go is the International Center . 
 Why ? 	 You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . 
 What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? 	 They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . 
 Can we get any more help at the International Center ? 	 Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . 
What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 	 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 You are going to take courses ? 	 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Won't you get lonely ? 	 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
What do you think of your teacher ? 	 He's very strict with us . 
Could you tell me how to use the library ? 	 Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . 
 How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ? 	 Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . 
 How long can I keep the books ? 	 For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . 
 I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ? 	 Yes , just over there to your right . 
Hi . What's your name ? 	 My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? 
 My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? 	 My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you . 
 Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ? 	 No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? 
 No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? 	 Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . 
 Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? 	 I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . 
 Why were you in Japan ? 	 My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . 
Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? 	 I register this Friday . 
 What classes do you plan on taking ? 	 I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . 
 Is that class really that popular ? 	 Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . 
 What other classes are you going to take ? 	 I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . 
 Is he an easy grader ? 	 I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . 
 Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? 	 Not at all . I got a 3.8 . 
 Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? 	 I got a 4.0 in that class . 
Did you get your grades yet ? 	 Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . 
 Why ? What happened ? 	 Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . 
 Why don't you re-take the class next year ? 	 That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? 
 That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? 	 I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . 
 What was your GPA before this semester ? 	 I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . 
 Why did it go down so much ? 	 Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . 
 What happened to you ? 	 I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . 
 How was your summer vacation ? 	 I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? 
 I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? 	 I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . 
 So are you officially a junior now ? 	 Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . 
 That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? 	 She dropped out of school completely . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . 
 Do you know how much they are paying her ? 	 I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . 
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? 	 You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . 
 Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? 	 No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . 
 Did you register yet ? 	 Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . 
 What classes do you think are still open ? 	 Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . 
 He does that ? 	 I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . 
Did you already take the history exam ? 	 Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? 
 Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? 	 I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 
 I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 	 Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . 
 What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? 	 I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . 
Can I help you ? 	 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 	 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 Can I check this one out ? 	 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ? 	 It was great ! How was your year ? 
 It was great ! How was your year ? 	 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 
 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 	 Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . 
Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? 	 No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? 	 I'm feeling better today . 
 How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? 	 About more three days , I think . 
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? 	 I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? 
 I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? 	 I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . 
 But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? 	 Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . 
 I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? 	 That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . 
 Really ? 	 Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . 
 Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? 	 Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . 
 How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? 	 That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . 
 So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? 	 Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . 
 Why did they want to found a college ? 	 Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . 
 When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? 	 In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . 
Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? 	 They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . 
 Would you consider it your favorite class ? 	 I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . 
 What class was your favorite then ? 	 I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . 
Did you ever take History 231 ? 	 Yeah . Last semester . 
 Who was the professor ? 	 It was Professor Johnson . 
 I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? 	 He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . 
 What did you end up getting ? 	 I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . 
 Are you enjoying the class so far ? 	 I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . 
Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? 	 It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . 
 Why ? What's stressing you out ? 	 School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . 
 What are you going to play ? 	 Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . 
 What do you mean by that ? 	 Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . 
 Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? 	 I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . 
 Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? 	 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . 
David , what do you want to do after graduation ? 	 I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? 
 I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? 	 That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . 
It's a sunny day , isn't it ? 	 Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you . 
 Are you American ? 	 No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? 
 No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? 	 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? 
 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? 	 Yes . What about you ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 	 Me , too . 
Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ? 	 Sure . What do you want to know ? 
 Sure . What do you want to know ? 	 Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 
 Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 	 Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses . 
 OK . And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ? 	 It can be completed in four years normally . 
 Oh , I know . When is it ? 	 December 1st . 
 What's on the test ? 	 It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten . 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 	 I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . 
Good morning , madam . I'd like to apply for a library card . Can you help me ? 	 Yes . Please give me your ID card , a photo . 
 OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? 	 Of course , as long as the card is well kept . 
Peter , which club do you want to join ? 	 I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? 
 I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? 	 I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? 
 I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? 	 But I don't know how to play basketball . 
 Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? 	 Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? 
Peter , have you finished your English composition ? 	 No . But I ’ m working on it . 
 Do you think you can finish it on time ? 	 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . 
 All right . But how ? 	 Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . 
 I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? 	 OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . 
 I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ? 	 I feel much better now . 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 	 I've already got it . Thanks . 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class , could you preview it ? 	 I will . 
Would you like to come to our party ? 	 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 What makes you say that ? 	 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
What's this then ? 	 It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 	 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 Oh , Yes ? 	 It's true , sir . 
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 	 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 	 Well done ! 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 	 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 	 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 	 Oh , yes ! 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 	 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 	 She's eighty-seven . 
Can I help you ? 	 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ? 	 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? 	 Harry Potter . 
 Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? 	 Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . 
 Have you ever read this book before ? 	 No , but my little brother likes it very much . 
 Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? 	 Jane Austen . 
May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? 	 Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . 
 But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? 	 What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . 
Can I help you ? 	 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 	 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? 	 Yes , it is . 
 Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? 	 No , I haven't began my preparations . 
 Then shall we make preparations together ? 	 Great . You can help me a lot with English . 
 All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? 	 No problem . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 	 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 	 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . 
 How long can I keep the books ? 	 For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer . 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 	 Yes , over there to your left . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 	 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? 	 Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . 
Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? 	 Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . 
 Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? 	 In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . 
 It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? 	 You'll get used to it gradually . 
 Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? 	 Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 	 Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . 
 Only for this reason ? 	 Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . 
How do I apply to an American university ? 	 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 What's to come next ? 	 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing .

 How about tomorrow ? 	 Ok . 
Where are you going ? 	 It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night .

 I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? 	 In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . 
 A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? 	 I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . 
 So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? 	 They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . 
 In what way ? 	 Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . 
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? 	 I don ’ t know . What do you think ? 
 I don ’ t know . What do you think ? 	 I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . 
 What do natives get ? 	 They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . 
 Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? 	 Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . 
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? 	 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 What do you do in order to improve your English ? 	 I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . 
 It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? 	 Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . 
 It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? 	 It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . 
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? 	 I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . 
 So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? 	 Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . 
 So you're learning Chinese songs ? 	 You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . 
 That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? 	 I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . 
 Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? 	 Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . 
How's your time spent in the United States ? 	 Well , pretty good . 
 I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? 	 Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . 
 You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? 	 That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . 
 I'm confused . Why did he say that ? 	 I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . 
Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? 	 Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? 
 Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? 	 Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! 
 Did you bow back ? 	 No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . 
 But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? 	 Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . 
 Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? 	 I think it's highly possible , yes . 
How long have you been in America ? 	 For more than five years . 
 Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? 	 It's no picnic . 
Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 	 Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 What ? 	 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 What is it ? 	 Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 That makes you feel uncomfortable ? 	 Yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 	 Yeah . 
Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 	 Sure , here you are . 
 Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 	 Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 	 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 	 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 	 Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 	 Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? 	 He asked me how long it took me to learn English . 
 What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? 	 You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . 
 So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? 	 I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . 
 Are you sure he really got the message ? 	 Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . 
 That's hilarious ! What did he say ? 	 He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 	 That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . 
 Is it true or isn ’ t it ? 	 Do you want to know something about the American character ? 
 Do you want to know something about the American character ? 	 I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . 
 After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? 	 Not exactly , but I see your point . 
What do you like to do with your free time ? 	 Study English . 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 	 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 You think ? 	 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
Eric , how long will you be in China ? 	 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 	 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 	 What is it ? 
 What is it ? 	 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 	 How about this sunday ? 
 How about this sunday ? 	 Ok , cool . 
Are you studying any languages here ? 	 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 What are you majoring in ? 	 I'm majoring in English . 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 	 Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 	 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
Are there many idioms in English ? 	 There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 Can you give us an example ? 	 I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
 What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 	 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . 
 What do I do with it ? 	 Do you want me to help you ? 
 Do you want me to help you ? 	 Please . 
 Sure , what's up ? 	 I have no idea where my class is . 
 Do you mind telling me where it is ? 	 Of course , which room number is it ? 
 Of course , which room number is it ? 	 Number 261 . 
 Can you please show me ? 	 I can do that . 
How are your Chinese lessons going ? 	 Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . 
How often do you have English lessons ? 	 I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . 
 How do you practice ? 	 I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . 
 Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? 	 Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . 
Do you mind helping me ? 	 What can I help you with ? 
 What can I help you with ? 	 I'm not sure how to find my next class . 
 Do you know what building that it's in ? 	 The C building , I think . 
 Could you point me in that direction ? 	 Do you know what the room number is ? 
 Do you know what the room number is ? 	 It's C261 . 
 Can you show it to me ? 	 Sure , let's go . 
How do I buy my textbooks ? 	 Do you have your book list for your class ?

 OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? 	 No , I didn't know I could do that . 
 You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? 	 Yes , I am going today . 
Where can I buy textbooks ? 	 First , you need to have the list of books for your class . Do you have that ?

 What is the most important factor ? 	 Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . 
 How can we keep track of our grades ? 	 The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .

Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 	 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 	 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . 
 What happened ? 	 No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . 
 Who was chairing the meeting ? 	 Bob . 
 What was the meeting about ? 	 We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . 
 Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? 	 You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . 
 Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? 	 You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . 
 It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? 	 I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . 
Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? 	 No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? 
 No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? 	 Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . 
 Zina ? Zina the Snake ? 	 I got your e-mail a couple of months back . 
 Yeah ? Which one was that ? 	 The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . 
 What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? 	 Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! 
 So he talks about you behind your back ? 	 Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
 There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? 	 They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . 
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 	 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? 	 No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? 
 No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? 	 Women are such dreamers . 
 What happened ? 	 My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . 
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? 	 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 	 I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 	 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 	 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
What do you think about violence in movies ? 	 Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . 
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 	 If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . 
 Why not ? 	 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 
 How about the new bar across the road ? 	 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 	 I don't care . 
You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? 	 I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . 
 I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? 	 Yes , too good to be true . 
 The last straw , huh ? 	 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 
 No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? 	 Yes , I have . But I have to wait . 
Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? 	 Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . 
 But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? 	 You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... 
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? 	 Why am I always the last to know these things ? 
 Why am I always the last to know these things ? 	 I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? 
 I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? 	 No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . 
 Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? 	 I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . 
 Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? 	 Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow .

Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? 	 No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 
 They're going to give us back the seats ? 	 No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... 
 Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? 	 You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . 
 What does it say ? 	 This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " 
 That's very nice . Is it for sale ? 	 No . I never sell my artwork . 
 Really ? Then what do you do with it ? 	 I give it away . Here , this one is for you . 
 But not as good as your mother's , right ? 	 Actually , it's better ... 
 What ? Are you kidding ? 	 No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 
Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? 	 No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! 
 I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? 	 I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax !

You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 	 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Do you like this campus ? 	 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 How come ? 	 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 	 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 	 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 	 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
You ’ re all set now ? 	 Oh , thank you so much . 
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 	 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .

 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 	 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 	 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 	 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it .

Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 	 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 	 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 	 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 What's the problem ? 	 My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . 
 Is there a problem ? 	 The delivery people showed up four hours late . 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 	 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 How ’ s that going ? 	 It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . 
 Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? 	 No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean .

 So , since when is your house a bank ? 	 What do you mean ?

 Then what shall I do ? 	 Call the police . 
Why are you so rude to your wife ? 	 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box .

 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 	 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 	 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 	 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it .

 Why don't you speak English ? 	 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 	 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 	 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 When will we begin ? 	 How about tomorrow night ? 
 How about tomorrow night ? 	 That's all right . 
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 	 Good idea . That might help .

Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? 	 I like them very much . They are delicious .

 It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 	 Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .

What courses are you taking ? 	 Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 	 To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring !

Who did the stupid thing ? 	 Maybe it was Dick . 
How did Jim get the money ? 	 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? 	 But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . 
 How about a training course ? 	 A training course ? That must be costly . 
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 	 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 	 You know you didn't . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 	 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .

Are you Elvin ? 	 Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? 
 Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? 	 I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . 
 It is ? 	 You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet . 
Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? 	 Stay away from me . 
 Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? 	 I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . 
 Don't know what ? 	 Let's just say there could be some big changes around here .

 Did you hear the names he was calling me ? 	 I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 
 What ? 	 She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . 
 What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 	 Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . 
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 	 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 	 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 	 Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 	 Did you have the room checked before we move in ?

 What's her figure ? 	 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 	 Dark blue . 
 how old is she ? 	 Twenty . 
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 	 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 	 I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 	 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 	 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 
Hi , Becky , what's up ? 	 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 What's the problem ? 	 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . 
 For example ? 	 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? 	 We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 	 I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 	 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 
Do you have to leave soon ? 	 No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 
 Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 	 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 	 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
 Where it is ? 	 It's a private garden . 
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 	 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 	 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 Didn't anyone stop them ? 	 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? 	 I don ’ t want to . 
 May I turn on the radio then ? 	 Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
 Turn on the radio ? What for ? 	 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 	 Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . 
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 	 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 	 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 	 I forgot . 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 	 Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 	 Hurry up , little boy . 
Er ... Alison ? 	 Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 	 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
Would you like a cup of coffee ? 	 Yes.That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 	 This machine is out of order . 
 You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? 	 I sure did . 
Mom , have we got any cookies ? 	 Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . 
 Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? 	 Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? 
Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? 	 120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ? 
 120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ? 	 I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 	 It's my dream . 
Who did the stupid thing ? 	 It must be Kate . 
 What's the difference ? 	 We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! 
 What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? 	 I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . 
 I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? 	 What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . 
Are you there , Mary ? 	 I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! 
 How much is my stamp ? 	 Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 
 Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 	 Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 	 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Oh , do you really think so ? 	 Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . 
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 	 Yeah , I'm afraid so . 
How's your new apartment ? 	 I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . 
 What's wrong ? 	 One of my neighbors has a dog . 
 Does it make a lot of noise ? 	 It barks all night long . 
You're going to abandon me , just like that ? 	 I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . 
 Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 	 I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . 
 Why ? 	 Her father is dying . 
 What did you do ? 	 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Why are we watching it anyway ? 	 Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . 
 Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? 	 Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 
 Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 	 Of course . 
 You want something to drink ? 	 Yeah , Got a Coke ? 
 Yeah , Got a Coke ? 	 Sure . 
Did you hear what she said to me ? 	 I heard it . 
 What do you think I should do about it ? 	 Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
How would you like your hair cut ? 	 I want it short . 
 Are they coming to Chicago again ? 	 Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . 
 Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? 	 Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . 
Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 	 Well , Mr . King is singing . 
 Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? 	 He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . 
 And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? 	 She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . 
 What ’ s happening ? 	 The ladder ’ s falling ? 
 The ladder ’ s falling ? 	 What ’ s Mr . King doing ? 
 What ’ s Mr . King doing ? 	 He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . 
 And is she helping him ? 	 No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . 
Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? 	 You don ’ t love me , Roy . 
I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? 	 What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 	 I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . 
 Then when did you go to sleep ? 	 About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . 
 When ? 	 About 2 o ’ clock . 
 Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? 	 You did , but I can ’ t help it . 
 This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? 	 Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . 
Could you do me a favor ? 	 What is it ? 
 What is it ? 	 Could you possibly give me a lift home ? 
 Could you possibly give me a lift home ? 	 All right . 
 Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? 	 Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? 
 Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? 	 No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . 
 So what ? 	 You're just jealous . 
Did you see that ? 	 No , I missed it . 
 How could you miss that ? 	 Someone was in the way . 
 You have any idea why ? 	 She broke up with her boyfriend . 
 Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? 	 He sometimes really drives me crazy . 
 What do you mean ? 	 I was very sad when I was laid off last year . 
 The last straw , huh ? 	 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 	 I don't care . 
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 	 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 	 Never ! But thank you for inviting me . 
Are things still going badly with your house guest ? 	 It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . 
 What ? 	 You gotta have some better deodorant . 
Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 	 I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . 
Any chance of using your telephone ? 	 You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . 
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? 	 You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . 
 How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? 	 He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
So , what happened ? 	 He never came . 
 I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? 	 Not possible . 
How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 	 I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . 
 Have you found anything yet ? 	 You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? 
 You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? 	 You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? 	 No , I won ’ t hear of it . 
Would you mind doing something for me ? 	 I would if I could . 
 Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? 	 Yes , With pleasure . 
 Would you like to go to the top ? 	 Yes , of course . 
 Until when ? 	 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 
 why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? 	 Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . 
 Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? 	 Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . 
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? 	 A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . 
 Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? 	 Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . 
You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? 	 No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . 
 Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? 	 No , thanks . I am okay . 
 Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? 	 I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . 
 Excuse me ? 	 Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . 
 Why would I spy on you ? 	 Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . 
 What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? 	 Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . 
You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? 	 Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
 Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? 	 But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . 
 I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? 	 Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . 
How's your new work , Carl ? 	 A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . 
 Again ? 	 That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . 
 What do you mean too late ? 	 By that time , you will be fired . 
Would you like to see our new shirts ? 	 Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 	 And not expensive either . 
 Are they ? 	 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? 	 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? 	 What's your method of learning ? 
 What's your method of learning ? 	 Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . 
 What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? 	 Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other . 
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 	 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 	 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? 	 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 	 First , I worked as a servant . 
How's your new car ? 	 Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
 You made a good choice , then ? 	 It's just what I want . 
 What did you think you were doing ? 	 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . 
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? 	 I don't want to . 
 May I turn on the TV then ? 	 Turn on the TV for what ? 
 Turn on the TV for what ? 	 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? 	 I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . 
Excuse me , I wonder if you could help me ? 	 Of course , what can I do for you ? 
 Of course , what can I do for you ? 	 Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . 
 Oh , what exactly is problem ? 	 Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night . 
Is anything the matter , sir ? 	 Yes , it's my steak . 
 What's wrong with it , sir ? 	 It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . 
 I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? 	 Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . 
 I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 	 Yes , please give me another Calsberg . 
 Can I bring you some dessert ? 	 No , thank you . I've had enough . 
 How about some coffee or tea then ? 	 Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 	 Yes , here you are . 
 Thank you . Do you want your money back ? 	 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 
 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 	 I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . 
Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 	 Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? 
 Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? 	 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ? 	 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 
Can I help you ? 	 Yes , can I return this article , please ? 
 Yes , can I return this article , please ? 	 May I know the reason , madam ? 
 May I know the reason , madam ? 	 You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . 
 When did you buy it ? 	 Last Saturday . 
 Can I see the receipt ? 	 Yes , here you are . 
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? 	 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ? 	 Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! 
 Alright . What is that you want to tell me ? 	 We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation ! 
Eric , how long will you be in China ? 	 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 	 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 	 What is it ? 
 What is it ? 	 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 	 How about this sunday ? 
 How about this sunday ? 	 Ok , cool . 
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 	 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 	 You know you didn't . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 	 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 
David , why don't you clean your room ? 	 I am not in the mood . 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 	 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? 	 No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . 
 I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? 	 I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . 
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? 	 How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . 
 What about the Yen ? 	 Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 	 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
 What about the afternoon ? 	 At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 
Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 	 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
Do you have s second ? 	 Sure . What do you want ? 
 Sure . What do you want ? 	 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 	 Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . 
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 	 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 	 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 When did you learn to dance ? 	 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 	 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ? 	 We will keep and return it later . 
 Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 	 You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . 
 Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? 	 We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . 
Yes , sir ? 	 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 
Hello , is this the ABC company ? 	 Yes , may I help you ? 
 Yes , may I help you ? 	 We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it . 
 What is your reservation number ? 	 Our reservation number is J - 221 . 
 You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ? 	 I ’ m sorry to say no . 
 That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 	 I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . 
What's that ? 	 It's a surprise ! 
 For me ? 	 Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . 
 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? 	 I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . 
Mary ? Are you still there ? 	 Yes . What do you want ? 
 Yes . What do you want ? 	 Did your bid win ? 
 Did your bid win ? 	 What do you care , dork ? 
 What do you care , dork ? 	 Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? 
 Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? 	 You mean fat boy ? 
 You mean fat boy ? 	 Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . 
 I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ? 	 And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
How do you get along with your co-workers ? 	 I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . 
 Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? 	 It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 	 I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . 
 That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? 	 I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . 
Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? 	 Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . 
 So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? 	 Yes . I ’ m sorry . 
 But you know if he brought it or not , right ? 	 Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 	 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
Would you go to the bookstore with me ? 	 It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . 
 Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? 	 Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . 
 So what are you interested in ? 	 Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . 
Hi , Becky , what's up ? 	 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 What's the problem ? 	 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . 
 For example ? 	 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? 	 Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . 
 They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? 	 Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . 
 What do you mean ? 	 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 	 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
You look really wiped out ? 	 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
Did you punch in ? 	 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 	 Sure , when those never ending meetings . 
Where will you go in your vacation ? 	 Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation . 
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 	 No , I'm not clear . 
 How about the soup ? 	 I've never tasted anything better . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 	 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
What upsets you ? 	 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 	 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 What makes you think so ? 	 She's my wife , you know . 
 What's it ? 	 You must have rolled over something just now . 
 The beauty under the tree ? 	 Of course.No girl is more charming . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 	 It is still a mystery to me . 
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 	 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 Oh , but why ? 	 I feel they're dirty . 
How do you feel about the TV series ? 	 Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . 
How much did you bid ? 	 Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! 
 What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? 	 You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . 
 What's up , Robert ? 	 Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight ! 
 Slow down . What are you talking about ? 	 It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now . 
 The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ? 	 Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . 
 Is it waterproof ? 	 Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . 
 Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? 	 Well , surfing , scuba diving ... 
What's that ? 	 It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? 
 It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? 	 Is that Hello Kitty ? 
 Is that Hello Kitty ? 	 Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! 
 Is it real gold ? 	 Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . 
Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? 	 Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! 
 Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? 	 It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . 
Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? 	 He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . 
 What happened ? Quarrel again ? 	 Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! 
 cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 	 ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 	 sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 	 that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 	 I don't think it's broken . 
isn't it wonderful walking here ? 	 what do you mean ? 
 what do you mean ? 	 I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . 
 it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 	 you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
 what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 	 quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark 
 what's there after that ? 	 well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
 what are all they for ? 	 most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . 
 really ? I thought you hated shopping ? 	 I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! 
 that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? 	 here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . 
 I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? 	 let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . 
 this is perfect ! What do you think ? 	 I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! 
Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? 	 Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . 
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 	 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 	 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 	 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 
Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? 	 A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . 
You are late . What ’ s the deal ? 	 Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic . 
 You think ? 	 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Do you have to remember every text ? 	 Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . 
What's all this noise about ? 	 They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . 
 Why ? 	 Because she's not responsible enough . 
Do you like playing tennis ? 	 I don't find it very exciting . 
Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ? 	 Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . 
 Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? 	 No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it . 
 Where do they come from ? 	 I don't know . Something rotten here ? 
 I don't know . Something rotten here ? 	 I can't see it . 
 So what are you trying to say to me ? 	 It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . 
 How should I say it ? 	 I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . 
 Like what ? 	 Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . 
 So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? 	 Definitely not . 
What do you think of being a secretary ? 	 I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . 
 How come ? 	 You have to type all day . 
 What is it ? 	 She keeps spitting on the ground . 
 what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? 	 not bad , any other ideas ? 
 not bad , any other ideas ? 	 well , there is a play on campus this weekend . 
 good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? 	 what's the matter with these ideas ? 
 what's the matter with these ideas ? 	 They are good , but i still need a few more . 
 what about going on a picnic ? 	 Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? 
 Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? 	 you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? 
 you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? 	 they are all good . 
Do you like our new history teacher ? 	 I'm fed up with his endless talking . 
Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 	 I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . 
I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? 	 Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do 
 Are you quite sure ? 	 Yes . Have a look . 
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? 	 It ’ s so cool ! 
So , Emily , how was your day ? 	 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 	 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 	 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 	 He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 	 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? 	 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 Why ? What are they like ? 	 They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! 
 Have you ever talked to them about it ? 	 I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! 
 What did they say ? 	 They both just talk about how great they are all the time . 
 What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? 	 Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . 
 What happened ? 	 First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . 
 What did your boss say ? 	 He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! 
 That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 	 That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . 
 Is your boss Chinese ? 	 No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . 
 What are you going to do ? 	 I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . 
 That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? 	 That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . 
I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ? 	 Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . 
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 	 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 How come ? 	 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 	 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
Jane , what do think about this dinner ? 	 Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . 
How do you like the pizza here ? 	 Perfect . It really hits the spot . 
 thanks ; do you like it ? 	 not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? 
 not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? 	 yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . 
 they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? 	 I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . 
 so are you enjoying your new job ? 	 it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . 
 how do you like working in sales ? 	 I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . 
 how do you know her ? 	 she's my cousin . 
 why didn't you tell me about that before ? 	 I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . 
you're rather energetic today . What's going on ? 	 nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees . 
 free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? 	 it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? 
 it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? 	 not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today . 
 why is that ? 	 my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
 your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? 	 you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
is everything alright ? 	 yes , everything is fine . 
 didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? 	 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 	 we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . 
 turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? 	 yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . 
 so where did you land ? 	 we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
 have you had anything to eat ? 	 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 
 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 	 I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
wow , it that your sports car ? 	 yes , do you like it ? 
 yes , do you like it ? 	 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 	 it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 what's wrong with it ? 	 well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 when's the last time you had it serviced ? 	 it must have been a few years ago now . 
 what else is wrong with it ? 	 the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 anything else ? 	 the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 why don't you get it all fixed ? 	 it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
so , how should we go to the theatre ? 	 let's take the bus . 
 if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 	 we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
did you get my email ? 	 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 
 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 	 sure . 
 how did the business trip go ? 	 well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? 	 no , should I have ? 
are you ready to go the concert ? 	 yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 
 yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 	 actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . 
 is your helmet comfortable ? 	 not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 
 is that your new bicycle ? 	 yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 
 yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 	 it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! 
 I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? 	 well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 
 well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 	 that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . 
 is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? 	 it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 	 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 	 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? 	 Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . 
 Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? 	 Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 	 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 	 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 And ? 	 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 And it's a brick ? 	 Yes . 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 	 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 	 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? 	 Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? 
 Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? 	 What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! 
 For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 	 Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . 
 What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? 	 Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . 
hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? 	 oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . 
 what ' the matter ? 	 the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . 
 anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? 	 it was good . I brough lunch from home today . 
 yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? 	 you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
 seriously ? 	 yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 
 Beth , what date is today ? 	 Today is Saturday . 
 What is the date today ? 	 Today is July 4th . 
 Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? 	 It is December 25th . 
 Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? 	 April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! 
 yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? 	 it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . 
 how about this blue sweater ? 	 that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 
 that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 	 yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? 
 yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? 	 that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . 
hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 	 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 is that inflation ? 	 inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . 
 has the government taken some measures to curb it ? 	 yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . 
 how ? 	 for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 	 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 	 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 	 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? 	 Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! 
 What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? 	 When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 	 Not funny . 
 Why not ? What's wrong with it ? 	 Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . 
 Would you like another one ? 	 No . Can I have my money back ? 
 No . Can I have my money back ? 	 Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? 
 Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? 	 A receipt ? 
 A receipt ? 	 Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . 
 Then why isn't there a notice ? 	 They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! 
 What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? 	 Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy . 
 Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? 	 Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain , use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head , keep distance from them , why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you . 
 What are you thinking of doing ? 	 I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . 
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 	 Yes , here you go . 
Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 	 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 	 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 	 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 	 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 So what do you think it is ? 	 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 	 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 	 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 	 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 What ? What did you buy ? 	 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 	 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 And ? 	 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 And it's a brick ? 	 Yes . 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 	 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 	 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 	 I think someone is stalking me . 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 	 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 What did you do ? 	 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Did he leave when you left ? 	 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 What did you do ? 	 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 	 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 	 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 	 Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 	 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 	 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 
What do you think of this one ? 	 Eh , so so . 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 	 Nah , not too flashy . 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 	 I guess . 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 	 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 	 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 	 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 	 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 	 No , I forgot to buy some . 
What are you doing ? 	 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 	 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 Really ? 	 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? 	 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 	 You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 Where are you going ? 	 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 	 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 	 haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 what's the problem ? 	 every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 	 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
Hi Mary , how's it going ? 	 well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 really ? What happened ? 	 it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 	 you know she probably feels just as bad . 
 the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 	 yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 oh , what's that ? 	 it's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? 	 I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? 
 I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? 	 oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . 
 Jack ? 	 yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? 
 yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? 	 I will never go out with him anymore . 
 why did you say so ? 	 last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! 
 oh , really ? 	 he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . 
 are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? 	 it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . 
 what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? 	 I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . 
 What were the odds ? 	 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 
 What is it ? What happened ? 	 I think someone is stalking me . 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 	 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 What did you do ? 	 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Did he leave when you left ? 	 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 	 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 	 more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
 oh ? What's that ? 	 well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . 
 what gift ? 	 it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift 
Are you cold ? 	 Yes , a little . 
 There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? 	 I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . 
 What did they say about the air conditioning ? 	 They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . 
 That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? 	 You can wear more clothes . 
 What happened ? 	 It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . 
 Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? 	 Yes , and you know what ? 
 Yes , and you know what ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? 
 I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? 	 Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 	 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 	 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 And ? 	 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 And it's a brick ? 	 Yes . 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 	 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 	 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
What's wrong with him ? 	 His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . 
This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? 	 Actually , my mother made it from scratch . 
So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ? 	 I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis . 
 And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ? 	 I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . 
 And , who is sponsoring your trip ? 	 My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . 
 And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? 	 Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 	 Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! 
 Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? 	 Fine , thank you .

 Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? 	 Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all ! 
 Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? 	 Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole !

It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
 How do you think of the weather today ? 	 I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . 
Can I help you , sir ? 	 Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . 
 Self-service ? 	 Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . 
 Are you serious ? 	 Yes . Are you traveling here ? 
 Yes . Are you traveling here ? 	 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . 
 What sign ? 	 Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . 
 What are you doing ? 	 I can't figure out which dress to wear . 
 Can I give you a hand ? 	 Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . 
Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? 	 Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . 
 What brought this on ? 	 I guess I'm glad exams are over . 
 Who was the director ? 	 I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . 
 What's wrong ? 	 Nothing really . 
Bob , what are you thinking about ? 	 I'm looking forward to going to America . 
 When do you go ? 	 Next week . 
 What's wrong ? 	 My hair looks hideous . 
 What's so bad about it ? 	 It doesn't look good at all . 
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? 	 I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . 
 Is there a good time for you to help me ? 	 If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . 
 How about meeting in my office ? 	 That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . 
What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? 	 Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . 
 Do we need to book a table in advance ? 	 No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . 
 What time shall we go ? 	 Why not now ? I'm hungry . 
What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? 	 I enjoyed myself , too . 
 Shall I give you a ride home ? 	 Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . 
How did you know ? 	 It was a kind of sixth sense . 
 Does it happen often ? 	 No . 
 Why are you considering trying for it ? 	 I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . 
 What is it about this job that appeals to you ? 	 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . 
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? 	 I am thinking that might be the case . 
What's your favorite magazine ? 	 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 	 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 	 No , it's a semimonthly .

 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 	 No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 	 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .

Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? 	 Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . 
 Great . What do you think of it ? 	 The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . 
 Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? 	 Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . 
 It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? 	 Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . 
 What is the special local product ? 	 The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious .

 How long until you're finished ? 	 I'm finished . What do you think ? 
 I'm finished . What do you think ? 	 I like my hair so much . 
 Do you really ? 	 It's beautiful . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 	 You owe me $ 55 . 
 There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? 	 Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . 
 Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? 	 No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?

Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 	 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 	 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 	 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 	 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
 Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? 	 For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . 
Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? 	 Is it formal or informal ? 
 Is it formal or informal ? 	 I guess it ’ s formal . 
 You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ? 	 The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . 
 Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? 	 It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . 
What's a good place for sightseeing ? 	 Don't ask me . 
Do you have a light ? 	 Sorry , I don't smoke . 
 So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 	 Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . 
 Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? 	 Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . 
 ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? 	 Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
 Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? 	 She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . 
 So , want me to book the tickets again ? 	 Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . 
What are you doing ? 	 I'm surfing the Net . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 	 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 	 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 	 I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 
 Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? 	 Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? 
 Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? 	 Yes , let's do it . 
 What ? Are you sure about that ? 	 Yeah , he is going to move next month . 
 Where is he going ? 	 He is going to Canada and to live with his son . 
 I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? 	 ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . 
 Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? 	 Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . 
 I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? 	 No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . 
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? 	 Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . 
 What do you mean ? 	 She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . 
 Were you suppose to be there ? 	 I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . 
How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? 	 Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . 
 Why ? What happened ? 	 Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 What about the party ? 	 It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . 
 So how long did you stay ? 	 I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . 
Do you like plum blossoms ? 	 Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more . 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 	 Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Do you smell the sweet scent ? 	 Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . 
What part did you get in the play this time ? 	 I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 
What is that you have there ? 	 Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . 
 How about one little hint ? 	 Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . 
Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? 	 We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 
 What is it ? 	 Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . 
 That's it ? That's the tradition ? 	 Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . 
 Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? 	 Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . 
 I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? 	 Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . 
Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? 	 Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 
 Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 	 I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 
 I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 	 Are they having a sale ? 
 Are they having a sale ? 	 Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . 
 That sounds great . Where should we meet ? 	 I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . 
 What do you think about these shoes ? 	 They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 
 They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 	 No . Not really . 
 It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? 	 For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 
Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? 	 Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . 
 How many hours do you work each day now ? 	 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . 
 That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? 	 I don't care . I need money . 
 Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? 	 Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . 
 ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 	 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Can I have a bite ? 	 Help yourself . 
Could you tell me the time ? 	 Pardon ? 
 Pardon ? 	 What time is it , please ? 
 What time is it , please ? 	 It's 9:30 . 
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? 	 Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? 
 Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? 	 Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . 
 Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? 	 Yes , that's her . 
 I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? 	 Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . 
 Where in London do you live ? 	 In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . 
 I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? 	 That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 
Dad , where are we off to ? 	 First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
 Where are we going to have a drink ? 	 There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
 There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 	 Yes ? 
 Yes ? 	 That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
 Sorry . How far is the museum ? 	 I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? 	 Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . 
 When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? 	 I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . 
 That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? 	 Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . 
 You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? 	 I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! 
 How do you get enough protein in your diet ? 	 Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . 
 Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? 	 I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . 
 How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? 	 That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 
 That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 	 Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . 
 Who taught you to put on make-up ? 	 It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . 
 Can you teach me how to do make-up ? 	 Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . 
 What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? 	 I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . 
 How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? 	 I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . 
 How did you grow such long nails ? 	 You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . 
What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? 	 I can't remember . 
 The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? 	 These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . 
Do you know where Helen is ? 	 She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . 
Did you hear about Neil ? 	 No , what ? 
 No , what ? 	 I hear that he's quitting . 
What sports do you think women excel at most ? 	 I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . 
 I mean which ones are they better at than men ? 	 Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . 
 That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 	 Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . 
 Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? 	 Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? 
Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? 	 No . How about you ? 
 No . How about you ? 	 Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . 
What's your favorite season ? 	 I like the freedom of summer with no school . 
How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? 	 I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! 
 Really ? 	 That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . 
 Are you serious ? 	 I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! 
 How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? 	 Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 	 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 	 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 You mean you didn't know much English then ? 	 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 	 First , I worked as a servant . 
 Can I read it when you're finished ? 	 Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . 
I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? 	 Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ?

 Does he even know how to speak English ? 	 No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . 
 What's the matter ? 	 Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . 
 God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? 	 Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 	 They could generally be divided into two categories 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 	 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 	 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 What ? 	 The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . 
Bob , you look pale . What happened ? 	 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 	 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . 
Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? 	 I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! 
 There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? 	 When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever .

Do you have any year-end benefits ? 	 I don ’ t know till now .

 They are not feeling satisfied ? 	 It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . 
 What about ? 	 All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . 
 Because you can see the results with the general public ? 	 That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . 
 Will it be an all day event ? 	 Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .

 Why don't you go talk to her ? 	 You think she's out of my league ? 
 You think she's out of my league ? 	 Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . 
 What do I talk about ? 	 It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . 
 Do you want me to go talk to her ? 	 No . Stay away from her . 
 You're serious ? 	 Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert .

 My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? 	 Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere .

 Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? 	 Yes .

 What do you do to deal with the stress ? 	 Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . 
 That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? 	 Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 
 Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? 	 Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . 
 What other activities will you have tomorrow ? 	 Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .

 Is it the same practice for all families ? 	 Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday .

 You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? 	 No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . 
 What is it ? 	 Let's not exchange any gifts at all . 
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? 	 Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .

 Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? 	 I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? 
 I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? 	 Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend .

 I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? 	 Yeah . Thanks for the talk . 
Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? 	 I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 .

 What do you mean ? 	 Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . 
 Crikey . Where did this happen ? 	 In Taichung , I think . 
 So what happened ? 	 Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . 
 Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? 	 So what happened next ? 
 So what happened next ? 	 Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . 
 I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? 	 That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . 
That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? 	 Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal . 
How did you first meet ? 	 My roommate invited both of us to dinner . 
 Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? 	 Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . 
When did you and Amanda meet each other ? 	 I met her about one year ago . 
 So you met her right after you got to school ? 	 That's right . We've been dating since last September . 
So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ? 	 Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . 
 Did he tell you what she was like first ? 	 Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . 
What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? 	 I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . 
 That's too bad . What happened ? 	 Well ... that's a long story . 
 Really ? Why ? What happened ? 	 Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . 
 So what did you do ? 	 Well , I actually thumbed a lift . 
 You what ? 	 Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . 
 You really have bad luck , don't you ? 	 Seems like it . 
So Kevin , what is your type ? 	 I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . 
What's the time now ? 	 Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . 
 You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? 	 In the coming , before going to work . 
Do you want to hear a funny joke ? 	 OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? 
 OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? 	 Well , you'll see . 
 A car door ? You mean just one car door ? 	 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 
 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 	 Well ... 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 	 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Is he ok ? 	 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 	 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 	 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 	 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 What position do you play ? 	 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 	 The Rockets . 
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 	 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 How hard is the climb ? 	 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 What did you do last week ? 	 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 	 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 	 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 	 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 	 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 	 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 	 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 	 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 	 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 	 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 	 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? 	 Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 
 Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 	 He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . 
Who are those guys ? 	 Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 	 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
Do you have girlfriend ? 	 Yes , why ? 
 Yes , why ? 	 Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . 
 So ? 	 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? 	 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? 	 That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 	 Yes . 
So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? 	 Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . 
 You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? 	 Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . 
 Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? 	 No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? 
 No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? 	 All right . See you tomorrow night . 
Good game ? 	 Not bad . But too hot for me today . 
 Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? 	 Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? 
 Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? 	 Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . 
 Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? 	 16 . Yours ? 
 16 . Yours ? 	 No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . 
 Me too . So , do you like the course ? 	 Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? 
 Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? 	 Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . 
 Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? 	 Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! 
 Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? 	 Yup . 
Have you seen this ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 They killed another hostage . 
 I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? 	 Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . 
 Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? 	 I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . 
 Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? 	 Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . 
 Really ? What happened ? 	 Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . 
William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? 	 He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . 
 It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? 	 I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . 
 Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? 	 I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . 
 That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? 	 I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . 
 I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? 	 I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . 
Are you busy with your work ? 	 Yes . What about you ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 	 Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . 
 Is this time one of them ? 	 Yes , we won't travel again until October . 
How's your work ? 	 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 	 Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . 
 Why ? 	 Because of the low salaries . 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? 	 I don't know why . 
 Why don't you give them a suggestion ? 	 May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . 
It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? 	 Yeah . It's already December , you know . 
Are you travelling in America ? 	 No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . 
 What do you do ? 	 I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . 
 Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? 	 I am a reporter at a TV station . 
 Do you like your job ? 	 Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . 
 Which kind of news do you catch ? 	 I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . 
 Are you feel tired ? 	 Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . 
Nice day , isn't it ? 	 It sure is . 
What are you up to tonight , Steve ? 	 I'm going to a disco with my friends . 
What time shall I pick you up ? 	 How about 6:30 ? 
 How about 6:30 ? 	 That'll be fine . See you soon . 
Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? 	 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 
 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 	 How about Legally Blonde . 
 Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? 	 Isn't that a scary movie ? 
 Isn't that a scary movie ? 	 How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . 
Hi . You enjoying the party ? 	 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 
 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 	 Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . 
 Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ? 	 I'm in finance . You ? 
 I'm in finance . You ? 	 Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them . 
 T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ? 	 About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? 
 About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? 	 No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... 
Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? 	 I'm at home painting . 
 I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? 	 I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . 
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 	 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 	 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Can I stop by ? 	 Sure . Any time . 
 Oh , yes ? 	 I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . 
Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ? 	 Oh , yes . You ? 
 Oh , yes . You ? 	 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 	 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 	 I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant . 
 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? 	 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . 
Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? 	 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . 
 Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? 	 We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
 Where would you like to sit ? 	 Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . 
 Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? 	 Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! 
 Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? 	 I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . 
 Why don't you get a new one ? 	 I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . 
 Really , what makes you say that ? 	 Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? 
 Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? 	 Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . 
 Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? 	 Three . Two boys and a girl . 
 What were the odds ? 	 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 	 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 	 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 	 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 	 Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . 
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? 	 He's not doing too well . 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 	 About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . 
 Oh , how could it be ? 	 Let's go out and have a look . 
 But don't you think it's a little too cold ? 	 But I like cold more than hot . 
 Will it snow today ? 	 I don't know . Do you like snowing ? 
 I don't know . Do you like snowing ? 	 Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . 
 Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? 	 Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon . 
 How long does the rainy season last ? 	 About two months . 
What do you do when you are angry ? 	 I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . 
 That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 	 Something like listening to music is a good idea . 
 Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? 	 Classic . Something that could calm your mind . 
 Like what ? 	 Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 	 Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring . 
What day is today ? 	 Today is Thursday . 
 What's the date today ? 	 Today is May first , 2003 . 
 Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? 	 Well , I don't think so . 
 Hi , Tom . How have you been ? 	 Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . 
Hello , Mary . How are you ? 	 Not bad . How about you , John ? 
 Not bad . How about you , John ? 	 Fine . Thank you . 
 What do you think will make you happy ? 	 I think money will make me happy . 
 No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? 	 Sure . Why not ? 
 Sure . Why not ? 	 OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . 
Hi ! Peter . How are you ? 	 Fine ! How about you ? 
 Fine ! How about you ? 	 Pretty good . 
 Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? 	 Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? 
 Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? 	 Not bad . But she's as busy as before . 
 Can you tell me how to improve myself ? 	 There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . 
How old are you , Su ? 	 I am seven . 
 We will have a party here , right ? 	 Yes , come on , and we will have fun . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 You never guess she is going to have a baby . 
Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? 	 Do you mean lying to people for their good ? 
 Do you mean lying to people for their good ? 	 Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? 
 Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? 	 It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . 
Have you got any hobbies ? 	 Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . 
 Which is easier to learn ? 	 Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . 
Hey ! What's up ? 	 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 	 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
Have you considered upgrading your system ? 	 Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . 
 How can we do that ? 	 You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? 
 You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? 	 No . 
Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 	 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? 	 Hop in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ? 	 Wow , this thing can haul . 
How is your new car ? 	 Perfect . Couldn't be better . 
 Why do you say so ? Can I see your new car ? 	 Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . ) 
How are your wedding plans going ? 	 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . 
 When will your wedding take place ? 	 At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . 
 It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? 	 Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 	 The Palace Hotel . 
Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? 	 Yes . She believes everything about him . 
 When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? 	 I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . 
 I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? 	 They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 Hi , An . How are you ? 	 I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? 
 I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? 	 I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . 
Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? 	 I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? 
 I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? 	 I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . 
 Oh , my . What did you do ? 	 I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . 
 Did you call the police ? 	 Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help . 
Which university did you graduate from ? 	 I graduated from Songhua University . 
 When did you graduate ? 	 I graduated from it in 2002 . 
 Was it quite special ? 	 Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . 
 Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? 	 Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . 
 What ? Won't you have more drinks ? 	 I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . 
 Are you going anywhere ? 	 I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 
 I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 	 Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . 
 Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? 	 Wonderful . 
 When is it ? 	 It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . 
 Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? 	 OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . 
 Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? 	 In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body . 
What is your hobby ? 	 I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . 
 What kind of reading materials do you like best ? 	 I am interested in science fiction . 
How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? 	 In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . 
 But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 	 You are deadly right . 
Any plans tonight ? 	 Not really , do you ? 
 Not really , do you ? 	 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 	 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? 	 Just did my best . 
 Such as ? 	 They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . 
 What does this mean ? 	 This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . 
 What special effects ? 	 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . 
 Can a handset case be changed ? 	 Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . 
 How many cases are accessible ? 	 There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . 
Do you think the bad weather will last long ? 	 I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . 
 Why not send them short messages ? 	 Can short messages reach them ? 
 Can short messages reach them ? 	 Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . 
 Why haven't I thought of this skill ? 	 I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . 
 I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? 	 I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . 
 Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? 	 Are you able to compose music ? 
 Are you able to compose music ? 	 No , not yet . 
 Who composed it for your ? 	 You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . 
 Can I get on line to search one , too ? 	 Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . 
 What about my SIEMENS ? 	 Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . 
How do you like this dress ? 	 It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? 
 It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? 	 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 
 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 	 Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . 
 Any other common customs of your New Year ? 	 Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . 
 What's that ? 	 It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! 
 By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? 	 We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . 
 What about the quality ? 	 Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . 
Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? 	 Yes , the snow is often falling thick and fast here . 
 By the way , where can I go ski ? 	 There are so many places around . Take a look at the advertisement . 
 Is he in ? 	 I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . 
 Is that where you park ? 	 Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . 
 Thank you . Where is your key ? 	 There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . 
 Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? 	 Here it is , and here we are . 
 Please excuse me , won't you ? 	 Certainly . Come back soon . 
 Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? 	 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ? 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ? 	 No problem . See you ! 
 Is it official ? 	 It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . 
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? 	 Okay ! What do you suggest ? 
 Okay ! What do you suggest ? 	 How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . 
 Is that so ? Why not ? 	 ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . 
 What's on ? 	 Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . 
 That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? 	 Ah . The Royal , I think . 
 What time does it start ? 	 Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . 
 Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? 	 Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . 
 Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? 	 Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . 
 What are the children doing ? 	 They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . 
 Who will get the money ? 	 Of course the children . 
What's that , a new video game ? 	 Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . 
 For instance ? 	 It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . 
 Wow ! Anything else ? 	 This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . 
 What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? 	 Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! 
When will the ceremony begin ? 	 The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? 
 The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? 	 No idea . 
 How can I forget my old friend ? 	 My best wishes to you and the bride ! 
 You don't want to join him ? 	 Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays . 
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? 	 I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . 
 When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? 	 Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . 
 There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? 	 I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . 
 There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? 	 I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . 
Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? 	 No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . 
 Where do they go ? 	 Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid 
 They go to the home of the bride ? 	 Why do you ask ? 
 Why do you ask ? 	 The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . 
 Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? 	 Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 
 Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? 	 Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . 
 Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? 	 The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . 
 Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? 	 I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . 
 One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? 	 Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . 
Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? 	 I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . 
 What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? 	 Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . 
 But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? 	 It's once in blue moon . 
 What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? 	 The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . 
 Sure . How do you like your seats ? 	 Ordinary one , please . 
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? 	 No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . 
 But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? 	 Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . 
Do you have anything to do after this ? 	 No , I don't . 
 Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? 	 That sounds like a good idea . 
 What's Net Love ? 	 Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . 
 Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? 	 How could you know ? 
 How could you know ? 	 I watched the screen display ! 
 & you ? 	 Look , I am playing the piano for you . 
Do you have a bf ? 	 Yes , I had a bf before . 
 Why you say bf before ? 	 We parted from each other last month .

 Mmmm , no . How about you ? 	 I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . 
 I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? 	 Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . 
 Hey ! What is it ? 	 I am flying like a bird . 
 I have no champagne right now . How about this ? 	 It's OK , so I send you this . 
 Is it made of chocolate ? 	 It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . 
 Are you sleepy ? 	 A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . 
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? 	 I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . 
 There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? 	 I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . 
 Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? 	 I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . 
 Do you have any successful stories to share ? 	 Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . 
How long have you been living in New York ? 	 Oh , about two years now . 
 Where do your parents live ? 	 They still live in Shanghai where I was born . 
 Do you write or call them very much ? 	 Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . 
 She's a real turn-on , alright ? 	 And look out she's dressed . 
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? 	 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . 
 Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? 	 Yeah , a number of times . 
Did you enjoy that new movie ? 	 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 	 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 	 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 	 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 What news ? 	 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 You know what we will get ? 	 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 What docking station ? 	 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 
What are your plans for this weekend ? 	 I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 	 Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop .

 So many ? 	 This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . 
 Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? 	 Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name .

 He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? 	 He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . 
The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? 	 Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . 
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 	 Sure , what's up ? 
 Sure , what's up ? 	 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 	 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 	 What do you mean ? 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 What's that ? 	 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 	 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 	 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? 	 Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . 
 Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? 	 I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . 
 All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? 	 Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . 
Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? 	 I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . 
 Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? 	 I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? 	 I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 How about some fish ? 	 No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . 
 OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 	 No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . 
 So what time tomorrow ? 	 Half past seven in the morning . 
 Where to meet ? 	 In the market . 
 But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? 	 Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . 
 But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 	 Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . 
Could you tell me the right time , please ? 	 Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . 
What is the correct time , please ? 	 It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 When will the lecture begin ? 	 It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . 
 What time are you leaving ? 	 I'll leave at 10 o'clock . 
Are you free tomorrow night ? 	 Yes , I am . 
 Shall we have dinner together ? 	 Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 
 Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 	 Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . 
What time is it , Tom ? 	 Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . 
 What's the hurry ? 	 I must catch the nine-thirty train . 
 Are you OK today ? 	 Quite good except thinking of you so much . 
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? 	 Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . 
 What was it about ? 	 Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . 
 I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? 	 Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . 
 That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? 	 Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . 
Who is your favorite NBA star ? 	 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? 	 Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 	 Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 Well then , what are your spoils ? 	 Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
Hmm , what should I wear today ? 	 Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . 
 Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? 	 I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . 
How do you like this waltz ? 	 It's very nice . I like it very much . 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 	 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? 	 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 	 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . 
Would you like a cigarette ? 	 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Really ? Why ? 	 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 	 That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 	 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 How do you know ? 	 Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! 
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? 	 Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . 
 How come ? 	 I don't know . 
 Why don't you phone her for a date again ? 	 I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . 
What are you using for bait today ? 	 We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . 
 It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? 	 Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . 
 Do you think they'll become reconciled ? 	 No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . 
Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? 	 Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director . 
 You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? 	 I have no idea . Tell me . 
 What does he do there ? 	 Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . 
Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? 	 Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . 
 Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? 	 He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? 
 He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? 	 Sure .

 What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? 	 Nearly everything . 
 You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? 	 Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . 
 Mm . What came after that ? 	 After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . 
 Any more ? 	 Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . 
How did you first meet Jack each other ? 	 That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . 
 And then ? 	 I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' 
 Then he sent you to your home ? 	 Yeah . 
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 	 I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . 
 A magic love potion ? 	 Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . 
 So what am I going to do ? 	 Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' 
 That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 	 Don't be so shy , Lucy .

 Which team do you back then ? 	 I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . 
 Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? 	 I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . 
 ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? 	 I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map

 Pretty , is she ? 	 Yes ... quite pretty . 
Can you lend me fifty bucks ? 	 What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? 
 What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? 	 I guess I don't earn enough . 
 So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? 	 I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . 
Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? 	 I needed some money , so I hocked it last week .

That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? 	 Of course . I always keep what I catch . 
 But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? 	 It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment .

 Yes . And what dances do you do best ? 	 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance .

 Is the entrance charge expensive ? 	 Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . 
 Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? 	 You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two .

 Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? 	 There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . 
 Are you from the south ? 	 No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . 
 So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? 	 I wish I could , but it's already late . 
How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? 	 I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday .

 Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? 	 To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 You mean there may be credit problems ? 	 Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . 
 Will you give some suggestion ? 	 Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . 
How do you shoot pool ? 	 You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . 
 And ? 	 You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . 
 How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? 	 At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . 
 Can I get the black ball in ? 	 The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . 
Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? 	 Certainly . What's the matter ? 
 Certainly . What's the matter ? 	 I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? 	 That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . 
 Is the service charged ? 	 No . it's free . 
 Can you tell me how it is done ?

And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . 
I'm better now . Want to play again ? 	 I'll let you break the balls this time . 
 OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? 	 You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles .

 What's the matter ? 	 I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . 
 A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? 	 ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' 
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? 	 Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . 
Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 	 No . Why ? 
 No . Why ? 	 There's a typhoon coming .

 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 	 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at !

 Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 	 Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
What happened ? Why didn't he win ? 	 Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
 What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 	 He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
 What's that ? 	 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 	 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 	 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 	 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . 
What date is it today ? 	 Today is December 23,2002 . 
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? 	 I don't think so . 
 How about going to a concert ? 	 That suits me fine . 
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? 	 Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . 
 Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? 	 Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . 
 Really ? What happened ? 	 He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . 
 I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? 	 I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . 
Hey , what's up ? 	 Oh , nothing . 
 What were you writing ? 	 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . 
 You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? 	 Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . 
 What note ? 	 I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . 
 Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? 	 Yeah , I want the note . 
Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ? 	 Speaking . Who's calling , please ? 
 Speaking . Who's calling , please ? 	 Hi , Mary . This is Tom . 
 Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ? 	 Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 
 Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 	 Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . 
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? 	 Sounds like a good idea . 
Does your girl friend like swimming ? 	 Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . 
 I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? 	 Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . 
So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 	 Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 
 Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 	 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 Do you know anyone in the play ? 	 Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? 	 That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? 	 Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 	 Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 
 Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 	 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 What did you do ? 	 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 	 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . 
 Why not ? 	 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 
 What should I do then ? 	 I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . 
 I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? 	 Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! 
Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? 	 Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . 
Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? 	 Fine , just fine . Thanks . 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 	 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 Are you doing anything special ? 	 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 	 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Do you have any plans ? 	 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 	 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ? 	 Fine , just fine . And you ? 
 Fine , just fine . And you ? 	 Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ? 
 Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ? 	 Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? 	 Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation .

 Should we go see it ? 	 I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . 
 Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 	 Great idea ! 
Another glass of beer , will you ? 	 Thanks , I'm enough . 
Have you gone bowling before ? 	 No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . 
 Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? 	 The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . 
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 	 Yes , are you ? 
 Yes , are you ? 	 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 	 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 	 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 	 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
May I know how old you are ? 	 I am 24 .

When and where were you born ? 	 I was born in Beijing in 1965 .

 No . Can I rent clubs ? 	 There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . 
 What kinds of clubs ? 	 Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . 
 What do you do with it ? 	 For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . 
Where is your native place ? 	 My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . 
 So are you a local ? 	 Yes , I am a local resident . 
 How about going to the theatre ? 	 I don't like going to the theatre . 
 Well , what do you like doing ? 	 Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 
 Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 	 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 
Where did you go yesterday ? 	 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 How often do you play tennis ? 	 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 	 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 	 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday . 
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 	 Yeah . 
 Who won ? 	 China . 
 What was the score ? 	 China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . 
Do you like traveling ? 	 Yes , I've just come back from Scotland .

 Why did you go there ? 	 I went there on business . 
 And do you have friends there ? 	 Yes , a lot of friends . 
So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? 	 Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . 
 And , is it what you found ? 	 Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . 
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? 	 Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . 
 Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? 	 Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . 
 Could you move smoothly ? 	 Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . 
 What happened afterwards ? 	 I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . 
How do you like skiing , Pat ? 	 I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . 
 I see . Do you ski often ? 	 Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . 
 Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? 	 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg 
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 	 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 	 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . 
 How come you think of him that way ? 	 Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . 
 Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 	 Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . 
Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ? 	 Yes , I am . What's up ? 
 Yes , I am . What's up ? 	 Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
 Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 	 With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 	 No . Just occasionally . 
 What's your favorite dance ? 	 It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz . 
 How about rock'n'roll ? 	 To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy . 
 And the tango ? 	 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 	 OK . 
Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? 	 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 
 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 	 Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . 
 Are we going to walk or drive ? 	 The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . 
 Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? 	 No , he's still sleeping . 
 How do we get to the library from here ? 	 It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . 
David , what have you been up to lately ? 	 I went on a trip with my family last week . 
 Really ? Where did you go ? 	 We went to Europe . 
 What cities did you go to ? 	 London , Paris and a few other cities . 
 Did you go to Berlin ? 	 No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . 
 And do you really love her ? 	 I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . 
How do you think should I handle this problem ? 	 You'd just let sleeping dogs lie . 
 She's always bothering me . What should I do ? 	 You'd better leave her alone . 
 I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? 	 It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway . 
By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? 	 Well , it's Thursday today . 
What time do you have ? 	 A quarter past five . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 	 I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . 
 I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? 	 OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? 
 OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? 	 Certainly . 
How are you doing , Christopher ? 	 To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! 
 Are you doing anything this weekend ? 	 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 Are you available on Sunday ? 	 Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . 
 Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? 	 That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
 That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 	 It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 What should I bring with me ? 	 We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 Do you like surfing ? 	 I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? 	 We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 	 You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 Ok , where and when should I meet you ? 	 We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? 	 I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . 
 But why do you choose cycling at first ? 	 Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection .

 So , will you marry me ? 	 I want to think of it for some time . 
I know you have a son . How old is he ? 	 He's going to turn six next month .

 When will you be convenient ? 	 Any time will suit me . 
 Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 	 I'm free tomorrow . 
 I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? 	 All right , see you then . 
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? 	 When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 
 When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 	 The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . 
 That's right . Why do you ask ? 	 Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . 
 When are getting married ? 	 Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
 Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 	 Do you like amusement parks ?

 When will you be free ? 	 Come by any time . 
 Shall I say around ten o'clock ? 	 Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 .

 Would you like to go to the concert with me ? 	 I'd like to , where ? 
 I'd like to , where ? 	 At our club . 
 When ? 	 At 7:30 p . m . 
Wow , is that your sports car ? 	 Yes , do you like it ? 
 Yes , do you like it ? 	 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 	 Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 What's wrong with it ? 	 Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 When's the last time you had it serviced ? 	 It must have been a few years ago now . 
 What else is wrong with it ? 	 The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 Anything else ? 	 The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 Why don't you get it all fixed ? 	 It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 	 I had to look after my son at home . 
 What's wrong with him ? 	 He has a fever .

 Do you like him ? 	 Yes , I do like him . 
 Then why are you hesitating ? 	 You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . 
Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 	 Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . 
 We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? 	 Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . 
Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? 	 They're my family 
 So you have two brothers ? 	 Yes , I'm the third child . 
I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? 	 Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . 
 Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? 	 In some way , she is more modern . 
Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? 	 Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . 
 Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? 	 She said it was because we had very different ideas about life .

Are you working or are you a student ? 	 I'm a student .

 You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? 	 Very well . If I leave I'll miss you .

May I invite you to dance with me ? 	 Sorry , I can't dance . 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 	 No , it is easy . 
 How should I do ? 	 You just follow me . 
 All right . By the way , do you often dance ? 	 Yup , because dance can relax myself . 
 Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? 	 My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . 
How will you spend this lovely weekend ? 	 I have no idea , any suggestions ? 
 I have no idea , any suggestions ? 	 We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ?

 Oh , how long ? 	 Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold .

I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? 	 Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! 
 Are you serious , John ? 	 All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . 
Can we sit on the grass , darling ? 	 No , you can't , darling . The grass is wet .

 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 	 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? 	 I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . 
What are you doing tonight ? 	 I have to run to the grocery store . 
 Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? 	 Yes , but I am out of food and milk . 
 What store do you shop at ? 	 The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand .

 But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? 	 You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . 
 I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? 	 Not at all . 
 What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? 	 I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . 
What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 	 My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 	 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 	 My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . 
 That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 	 We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 	 Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
What do you think of the coming match ? 	 Winning is a piece of cake to me . 
What are you doing now , Steven ? 	 I am reading a book about money management . 
You like movies ? 	 Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . 
 What type do you like the best ? 	 Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . 
Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? 	 We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . 
 Like what ? 	 Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 	 Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 Was it a very old house ? 	 It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 Is it in a good location ? 	 The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? 	 Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head 
 Why do you say so ? 	 He's always confused by easy questions . 
Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 	 No . what's it like ? 
 No . what's it like ? 	 It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! 
 Would you want to live there ? 	 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . 
 What's your dreamhole like then ? 	 My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England . 
 Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 	 Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? 	 No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 	 No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more !

 For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 	 Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 Is there anything else bothering you ? 	 Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .

I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . 
 What did it say about you then ? 	 For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink .

 Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 	 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 Really ? What do the companies do that for ? 	 I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 Do we need an appointment beforehand ? 	 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? 	 That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ?

 Is she American ? 	 Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 	 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 	 Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 	 You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? 	 Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ?

I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 	 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . 
 What is it ? 	 The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 
 What time are you leaving ? 	 1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m .

 Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? 	 She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " 
 Very romantic ? 	 Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . 
 You married him for that reason ? 	 Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . 
 Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 	 Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 	 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? 	 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
Do you feel better ? 	 Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
 What happened ? 	 My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . 
 How did you find him at last ? 	 It was the police wo helped me to do that . 
Did you get the car you wanted ? 	 No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . 
 What about the car over there ? 	 It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . 
 They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ? 	 I don ’ t know . 
What's this , I wonder ? 	 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . 
 A coffee grinder ? 	 Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . 
What do you think of smoking ? 	 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 	 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 	 Maybe it can take effect . 
Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? 	 I heard it might rain . 
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 	 No , nobody . 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 	 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 	 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 	 There , on the window . 
Are you a smoker ? 	 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 	 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 	 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 	 Yes . Twice . 
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 	 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . 
Hey , where's Cindy ? 	 She told me that she's got tennis practice today . 
 You're Mary , right ? 	 How did you know ? 
 How did you know ? 	 Cindy told me about you in our gym class . 
 I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? 	 My house is next door to yours . 
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 	 I think you'd better apologize . 
 What do you mean ? 	 I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . 
 Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? 	 Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . 
 Hey , what's the time ? 	 Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . 
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 	 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 	 Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well . 
 I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? 	 lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . 
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 	 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
Guess who I saw just now ? 	 Who ? 
 Who ? 	 John Smith , the escaped criminal . 
Cindy , I have this room to myself ? 	 It's all yours . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 	 It's got to be almost a year now . 
 How have you been ? 	 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 	 Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 	 Mrs . Thou ? 
 Mrs . Thou ? 	 Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? 	 I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . 
 No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? 	 I don ’ t know . 
How is Jim recently ? 	 He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . 
How is Rose now ? 	 It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it . 
John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 	 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 
 What was wrong ? 	 You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . 
So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? 	 Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . 
What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 	 How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
 Me , too . What did you have in mind ? 	 I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
 Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 	 The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
 Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 	 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
 Any other ideas ? 	 There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 
How ’ s your trip going ? 	 Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here 
 Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? 	 Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . 
 I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? 	 Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . 
 And what about the number of people on the streets ? 	 Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . 
Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? 	 That's because Americans love sitcoms . 
 Sitcoms ? 	 Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . 
Have you been to Shanghai before ? 	 Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . 
 That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? 	 No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . 
 So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? 	 Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! 
Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? 	 Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday . 
 Oh wow . How was it ? 	 Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 
 Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 	 Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . 
What happened to you yesterday ? 	 Oh I fell over on the way to work . 
 Oh I see . So that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? 	 Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn ’ t call you . 
 Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 	 No , we met at university . 
Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? 	 Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . 
How did you meet your boyfriend , Cindy ? 	 We were in the same science class last term . 
 Who made the first move ? 	 I did . 
 What do your parents think of your dating a boy ? 	 They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend . 
Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? 	 No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . 
Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? 	 Dinner ? Where ? 
 Dinner ? Where ? 	 At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 	 It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . 
Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? 	 Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . 
 You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? 	 My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . 
 Until college ? 	 Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . 
 Are you angry , Lisa ? 	 Angry ? Why would I be ? 
 Angry ? Why would I be ? 	 Please don't tell my mom . 
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 	 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 	 Of course ! 
Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 	 Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 What are they ? 	 One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 Why ? 	 The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 What's that ? 	 Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 So what happened ? 	 Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 
Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? 	 That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
 Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? 	 Well how about meeting at my place ? 
 Well how about meeting at my place ? 	 That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . 
So do you think you can get to the office alone ? 	 Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi . 
 Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ? 	 If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . 
 Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ? 	 I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed . 
What's your favorite book ? 	 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 Why do you like it best ? 	 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 	 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 	 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
What's that book you have under your arm ? 	 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 	 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 
 Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 	 I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health . 
Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 	 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 Why ? 	 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 
Where are you going this weekend ? 	 I ’ m going to Hainan . 
 Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? 	 Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . 
 I see . What ’ s it like there ? 	 Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! 
 Do you ? 	 It's a very good game . 
 Do you watch it or do you still play it ? 	 I only watch now . 
 How can you be so sure ? 	 He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . 
Did you have a good weekend ? 	 Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . 
 Oh I see . So what did you do then ? 	 I washed my car instead . 
 Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? 	 No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . 
How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ? 	 Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . 
 Oh really ? What did you do ? 	 We watched lots of television and films . 
 I see . Anything else ? 	 Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine . 
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? 	 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 	 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 How ’ s your son these days ? 	 Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 	 I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 	 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . 
How ’ s your father ? 	 He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 	 In the same way , probably . 
How long have you been in England ? 	 For almost two years . 
Lovely day , isn't it ? 	 Oh , yes . Beautiful . 
 You are not English , are you ? 	 No , I am from France . 
Can you tell me a little about Paris ? 	 Sure . What do you expect to know ? 
 Sure . What do you expect to know ? 	 I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... 
 That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 	 The night life there . It's so romantic ! 
 Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? 	 I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . 
What are you doing this weekend ? 	 Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned . 
 So you ’ re free on Saturday night ? 	 That ’ s right . 
 Would you like to have dinner with me ? 	 Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? 	 Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then . 
Have you ever been to Britain ? 	 Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . 
 Really ? How often do you go there ? 	 Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . 
 Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? 	 I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business . 
Are you free this evening , Li ? 	 I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . 
 What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 	 No , I haven ’ t got any plans . 
 Shall we go out tomorrow then ? 	 Why not ? Sounds good to me . 
So John , have you ever been to China before ? 	 No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China .

 I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? 	 You look great . Your make-up is perfect . 
 Do you think I should wear a different dress ? 	 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 
 Thanks for saying . Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? 	 With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . 
 Thanks for helping out . Now that I ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ? 	 Not much , just a house party with some friends . 
 Sounds fun . Anyone I know ? 	 Yeah , most of the people are from our office . 
 Where else haven't we been to yet ? 	 They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? 	 Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors .

 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 	 Yeah . I think I can find it . 
What's Beijing like ? 	 It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . 
 What can I see in Beijing ? 	 You can see the Forbidden City . 
 What ’ s it like ? 	 It ’ s beautiful but crowded . 
 Why ’ s that ? 	 Because too many people in the office are on holiday . 
What does your sister look like , Mike ? 	 Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . 
 Is she like you ? 	 I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . 
 Is she as clever as you ? 	 No , she ’ s not as clever as me . 
Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? 	 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking .

 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 	 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 What would you do at the party ? 	 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes .

 So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ? 	 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 	 Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day .

 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 	 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .

 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 	 Sure , but how ?

 Is everything ready now ? 	 Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . 
 Are you serious ? 	 Yes , I mean it . 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 	 No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 	 Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ...

What ’ s your new job like ? 	 Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office . 
What happened , John ? 	 Nothing . 
 Why do you look unhappy ? 	 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 	 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 Then what shall we do ? 	 Call the police . 
Hello ? 	 Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 	 I ’ Ve no idea . Nothing really . 
 How about going hunting with me ? 	 Wonderful . 
Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? 	 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 	 I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 	 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 	 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 	 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? 	 I got my father ’ s goat last night . 
 What did you do to get his goat ? 	 When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . 
 Is that true ? 	 Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . 
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 	 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
Does Tom drink a lot ? 	 Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 	 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 	 I went to Paris . 
What did the boss say to you ? 	 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 What does his dad say ? 	 John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . 
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 	 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 	 I'll beat him . 
What did he say ? 	 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
You married Joe , didn't you ? 	 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
Where is Tom ? 	 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 	 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 	 What ? Beg your pardon . 
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 	 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 Are you sure of that ? 	 I am not certain about that . 
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 	 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Really ? 	 Last night he told the children acliff-hangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
Why are you so rude to your wife ? 	 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
What will happen to the children if you break up ? 	 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 	 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 	 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished . 
Mary , how was your date with john ? 	 It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 	 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 	 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 	 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 	 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 	 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 What was your childhood like ? 	 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 Where did you go to university ? 	 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 What is your current occupation ? 	 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
 Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? 	 No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . 
 Do you like your current job ? 	 Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . 
How was the movie last night ? 	 I didn't really like it . 
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 	 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 	 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 When did you learn to dance ? 	 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 	 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 How about tango ? 	 Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 	 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) 
 What a bummer ! You set me up ? 	 Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 Why did you lie to me in the email ? 	 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 	 Waiting for someone . 
 You mean the boy you met on MSN ? 	 You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 Did you tell him ? 	 Yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 	 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 Why not ? 	 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 	 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 	 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there .

What is up ? 	 Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ...

 Why do you say so ? 	 Because he stayed with me all the time that night . 
Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? 	 Yeah , I know . 
 Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ? 	 I am not sure . 
What did you say when she told you the news ? 	 I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . 
 Why do you say so ? 	 The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . 
Who broke the glass , Peter ? 	 That cat . 
 So ? 	 So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg .

 Why do you say that ? 	 Whatever things get tough , he gives in . 
 Really ? How do you know that ? 	 Her marriage was a hole and corner affair . 
 Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? 	 I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ...

 Why ? 	 The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . 
Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? 	 No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake .

 Why ? 	 He has a finger in the pie . 
What are you worrying about ? 	 I am worrying about my husband .

 Which flight ? 	 Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . 
 How about the passengers ? 	 Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . 
 Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ? 	 I have no idea . 
 Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? 	 Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? 
 Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? 	 Ok . 
Have you finished your work ? 	 Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby . 
 Where is the baby ’ s mother ? 	 She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . 
 Why do you say that ? 	 I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin .

 May I introduce myself ? 	 Yes . 
How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 	 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 What do you mean ? 	 They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets .

 Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? 	 All right . See you then . 
 When are you off ? 	 I'm flying home on Sunday afternoon . 
 What time are you leaving ? 	 I'm going to try to leave by ten . 
Do you want to go shopping with me ? 	 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 	 How about Saturday morning ? 
 How about Saturday morning ? 	 Sounds good . 
 When do you leave ? 	 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
What's the bonus like at your company ? 	 Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . 
 What did you buy ? 	 A new home health monitor . 
 Today ? 	 Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . 
 Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? 	 Fine , only a little tired . 
 That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? 	 Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . 
Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? 	 Yes , I did . I passed ! 
 Was it ? 	 Sure it was . 
 I see . Where are you now , Li ? 	 Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . 
 It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? 	 I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! 
 So what ? Are we going anywhere ? 	 Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . 
 Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? 	 What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . 
 Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? 	 No problem . 
You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 	 I'm sorry , It's all my fault . 
 It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? 	 I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . 
 You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? 	 I can't afford to . 
 All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? 	 Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . 
 What do you mean by us ? 	 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 	 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
Jenny , are you having fun here ? 	 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 	 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
Many happy returns of the day , darling ? 	 Thank you very much . 
 Do you like it ? 	 I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . 
You ’ re all set now ? 	 Oh , thank you so much . 
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 	 What ’ s it for ? 
 What ’ s it for ? 	 It ’ s for a book . 
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 	 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? 	 I don ’ t really mind . 
How about a movie tonight ? 	 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 	 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 How about a snack after work ? 	 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Would you rather stay home ? 	 Whatever you say . 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 	 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 So what ? 	 You want to watch , don ’ t you ? 
 You want to watch , don ’ t you ? 	 Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games . 
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 	 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
 Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? 	 Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . 
 What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? 	 Helen is nice but she talks a lot . 
Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? 	 nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . 
 Are you sure you cann't remember ? 	 I've absolutely certain . 
 Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? 	 I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
 Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? 	 No , I didn't . 
 Sure ? 	 Quite sure . 
Do you take a bus to and from work ? 	 Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . 
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 	 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! 
 Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? 	 Yeah , absolutely ! 
 You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? 	 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . 
 A house warming party ? 	 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 	 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 	 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 	 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 And what did the program say ? 	 It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . 
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? 	 Umm ... I think so . What's up ? 
 Umm ... I think so . What's up ? 	 I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . 
 Really ? Are you OK ? 	 I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? 
 I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? 	 If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . 
 Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? 	 Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . 
 That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? 	 Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . 
 So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? 	 That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . 
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 	 Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 	 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? 	 I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . 
 You mean they're kicking you out ? 	 Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 	 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 	 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 	 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
Do you have much experience with kids ? 	 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 	 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 	 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 	 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 	 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 
How good are you at sports , Bill ? 	 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 	 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 	 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 And then what ? 	 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 	 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . 
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? 	 Uh ... what game ? 
 Uh ... what game ? 	 Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! 
 Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? 	 Football of course ! 
 So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? 	 Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? 
 Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? 	 Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . 
 It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? 	 Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 	 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 	 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 	 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 	 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 	 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 	 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? 	 Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . 
 Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? 	 I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . 
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? 	 I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . 
 It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? 	 You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . 
 So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? 	 It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! 
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? 	 Coming as ? 
 Coming as ? 	 Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! 
 Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? 	 Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . 
 Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? 	 Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . 
 Feed them ? 	 Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 
 And then later everyone eats the food ? 	 Yes ! How did you guess that ? 
 Yes ! How did you guess that ? 	 It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? 
 It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? 	 Good Point ! 
 But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? 	 No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? 
 What are you worried about ? 	 I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . 
 How much dose that cost ? 	 Around 200 RIB for a truck . 
 Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? 	 What do you mean ? 
 What do you mean ? 	 I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . 
 Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? 	 Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? 
 Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? 	 It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . 
 What happens then ? 	 Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . 
 We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? 	 It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . 
 What happened ? 	 Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . 
 Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? 	 What is that ? 
 What is that ? 	 A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . 
Who ’ s that ? 	 It ’ me . Susan Taylor 
 That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? 	 It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . 
 What kind of house is it ? 	 It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 
 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? 	 No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . 
 Yeas , when will you buy a house ? 	 Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . 
Did you move into your new apartment ? 	 Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . 
 Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? 	 Unfortunately , yes . 
 What do you mean by that ? 	 I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . 
 Is there a supermarket nearby ? 	 Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . 
Can you believe the headlines ? 	 What are you reading ? 
 What are you reading ? 	 I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ? 	 He got arrested all right . 
 So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ? 	 He's giving lectures on business at colleges . 
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 	 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 	 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 	 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 	 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 So what did you do ? 	 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 	 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 	 Yeah , about . 
 Do you know Chinese better now ? 	 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 
So do you believe in palmistry ? 	 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 	 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 	 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 	 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 	 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 	 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 Why can't we ? 	 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 	 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 	 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 	 No , have they have another fight ? 
 No , have they have another fight ? 	 No , they got engaged . 
 So when did this happen ? 	 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? 	 Next june . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 	 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 	 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 	 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 What'd he do ? 	 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 	 I suppose I do . 
 Why not ? 	 I have to see my daughter . 
 When poyou have to see her ? 	 I have an appointment at one fifteen . 
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 	 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 	 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 	 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
Have heard of Paul ? 	 No , what ? 
 No , what ? 	 He's got a promotion . 
 You are not serious ? 	 We had extra time of course . 
What do you think of doctor Thomson ? 	 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
 How can you be so sure ? 	 I can tell form the way he spoke to us . 
 What did she say ? 	 She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . 
Do you think they two will get married ? 	 You can count on it . 
 You thing so ? 	 Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? 
 Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? 	 Tomorrow morning.Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 	 Of course , easy.No sweat . 
 You want to bet ? 	 Yeah , what't the bet ? 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 	 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 Why ? 	 Well , I want to earn more . 
How are you , Sue ? 	 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 	 He is fine . 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 	 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 	 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
Are you all right ? 	 I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 	 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 	 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 
Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 	 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 How are you these days ? 	 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 	 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 	 I feel much better now . 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 	 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 	 I will . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 	 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 	 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 	 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . May I help you ? 	 May I introduce myself ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 	 Yes . 
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 	 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 	 No , thanks . 
 Why is that ? 	 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 	 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? 	 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? 	 No , it ’ s my sister . 
 How old is she ? 	 She ’ s 18 . 
 She is tall ? 	 Yes , she is . 
 And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? 	 Well , just a little thin . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 	 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 	 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . 
 Is there anything else ? 	 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . 
 How old is he ? 	 He is in his late thirties . 
 Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? 	 At two thirty . 
Is this your new teacher ? 	 Yes , it is . 
 Is she short ? 	 No , she ’ s average . 
 What color are her eyes ? 	 They ’ re dark gray . 
 What color is her hair ? 	 It ’ s blond . 
 And how old is she ? 	 I don ’ t know . 
Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? 	 Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . 
 Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 	 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? 	 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 	 No , do you want to go and do something ? 
 No , do you want to go and do something ? 	 Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . 
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 	 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Do you like this campus ? 	 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 How come ? 	 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
What are you grinning about ? 	 Stephany said she would go out with me . 
 All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? 	 We ’ re going fishing . 
 When is the last time you talked to you parents ? 	 I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well . 
 Are you going to see them soon ? 	 I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . 
 OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? 	 I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . 
Did you like the party ? 	 Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . 
 Why ? What had you expected ? 	 I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
 What does she like to do ? 	 She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . 
 Have you thought about going in Dutch ? 	 Dutch , where is that ? 
 Dutch , where is that ? 	 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 	 Two . French and Spanish . 
 And how well can you speak them ? 	 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 And how about your Spanish ? 	 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good .

I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 	 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 	 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? 	 It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk .

 What ? In your cubicle ? 	 Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home .

 What's it like to work with her ? 	 She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . 
 What if I said no ? 	 Ever hear of WebTracker ? 
 Ever hear of WebTracker ? 	 You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . 
 Do you think we'll make it ? 	 I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . 
Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? 	 No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ?

OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? 	 I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . 
 Mm-hm . How long were you there ? 	 I was there for almost a year . 
 So , did you , did you lose your finger ? 	 Almost . 
 Will you be going back to Australia soon ? 	 I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . 
 We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? 	 Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . 
 OK . What are the biggest cities ? 	 The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . 
 OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? 	 I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . 
 Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? 	 Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . 
 What's another Japanese art ? 	 Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! 
 How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? 	 There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . 
 What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? 	 Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . 
 Do ya ? 	 Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . 
 Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? 	 Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
 Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? 	 The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . 
 That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? 	 Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . 
 So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? 	 I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . 
So will you come to work with us ? 	 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 
 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 	 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 
 You miss me , don't you ? 	 Don't push your luck , Dave . 
 OK , I'm in . When do I start ? 	 As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 	 Exactly . 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 	 How ? 
 How ? 	 Because I won't let it fail . 
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? 	 Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . 
 Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? 	 Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! 
 Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? 	 Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . 
 OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? 	 Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . 
 Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? 	 Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . 
 Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? 	 Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! 
 Is that how you feel on the bus ? 	 Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . 
 So , so you're British , do you missing them ? 	 Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . 
 Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? 	 I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . 
 And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? 	 Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . 
 Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? 	 Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . 
 Can't Elvin handle it ? 	 I think he's got too much on his plate . 
 Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? 	 That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . 
 Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? 	 You can say that again ! 
 What's up with Vince and Elvin ? 	 They work for Zina now . 
 And they're happy with that ? 	 They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . 
 You do ? 	 Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? 	 I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 
 I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 	 Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? 
 Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? 	 That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 
 That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 	 I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division .

 I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? 	 God ! It's freezing ! 
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? 	 I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . 
 I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? 	 I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . 
 I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? 	 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 	 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? 	 Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? 
 Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? 	 Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . 
 I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 	 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . 
Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? 	 Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . 
 What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? 	 We should choose from the backups . 
 Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? 	 I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . 
 Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? 	 Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . 
 Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? 	 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 
 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 	 Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? 
 Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? 	 I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . 
 Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? 	 That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . 
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? 	 To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . 
 Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? 	 Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . 
 Who plays who ? 	 Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . 
 It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? 	 In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . 
 Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? 	 You are always so naughty . 
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? 	 Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . 
 Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? 	 We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . 
 Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? 	 Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . 
 Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? 	 Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . 
 Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? 	 Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . 
 That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? 	 Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? 
 Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? 	 Exactly , now , tell me the time . 
 OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? 	 As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . 
 Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? 	 Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . 
 Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? 	 Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . 
 I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? 	 Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . 
 Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? 	 Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . 
 Really ? 	 He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . 
 OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? 	 Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . 
 Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? 	 Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 	 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 	 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 	 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 	 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 	 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? 	 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 	 News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . 
 Is there anything interesting ? 	 Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . 
 I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 	 Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 	 Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
 I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 	 Yes , 50 Yuan per month . 
 Why ? Do you know that guy ? 	 No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . 
 What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? 	 Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . 
Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? 	 Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . 
 Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? 	 You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . 
 Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? 	 I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . 
May , is the university a terrible place ? 	 Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? 
 Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? 	 Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . 
 Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? 	 Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . 
 What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? 	 This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 	 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 	 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
 There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? 	 Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . 
 I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? 	 I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet .

 Do you know other famous animals in the world ? 	 Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . 
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? 	 Is that different from this kind of zoo ? 
 Is that different from this kind of zoo ? 	 Yes , of course . 
 Special rules ? 	 There , you only have two ways for visiting . 
 Details ? 	 On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . 
 Why not ? 	 Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . 
 That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? 	 Yes . 
 Is it horror movie ? 	 Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? 
 Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? 	 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Well , What kind of movies do you like ? 	 Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . 
 Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? 	 Sure . Now you are talking .

 Sure . What's playing ? 	 Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? 
 Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? 	 Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . 
 Who is the director ? 	 Steven Spielberg . Another superstar .

 They come to the earth ? 	 No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . 
 Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? 	 OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . 
 That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? 	 Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . 
 Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? 	 That's great ! 
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? 	 He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . 
Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 	 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 	 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
What will happen to the children if you break up ? 	 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 Are you sure of that ? 	 I am not certain about that . 
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 	 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Really ? 	 Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 	 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 	 What ? Beg your pardon . 
Does Tom drink a lot ? 	 Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 
What did her boss say to you ? 	 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 	 Yeah . 
 Are you sure ? 	 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 	 Partly , and he's also a hard working man . 
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 	 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 	 I went to Paris . 
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 	 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 	 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 	 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 	 Someone told Joe off . 
 Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 	 No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . 
 Huh ? 	 I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? 	 It is ? Oh , that's nice . 
 Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? 	 Actually , I'd forgotten about it . 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 	 Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 	 Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 	 Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . 
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? 	 Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . 
 Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? 	 Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . 
 Why do you say that ? 	 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 	 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 How much do you make ? 	 I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
Which church do you attend ? 	 I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . 
 What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? 	 Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . 
 Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? 	 That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . 
 Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? 	 Yes . 
 Why do you really go to church ? 	 We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . 
Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? 	 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .

Where are you going ? 	 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .

Is this watch yours ? 	 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? 	 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 
 What's the cause ? 	 The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 	 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 	 I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? 	 I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend .

Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? 	 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 How do you find the prices there ? 	 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 	 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
You're from New York , aren't you ? 	 Yes , that's right . 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 	 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 	 No , I don't like museums . They're boring . 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 	 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 	 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good .

 With the job ? 	 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .

 What day is it on earth ? 	 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 What time is your appointment ? 	 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 	 I don't know what time it is . 
Do I need a visa ? 	 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? 	 I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? 	 Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? 	 All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? 
You know John ? 	 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 	 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 	 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 	 Good luck to them . 
What ’ s your working day like ? 	 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 	 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 Do you have any breaks ? 	 We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 	 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 	 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 	 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? 	 I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 	 I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . 
 That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 	 No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 
 No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 	 Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . 
What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? 	 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 	 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 	 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 What else do you suggest ? 	 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . 
What ’ s your city like ? 	 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 	 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 	 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 	 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 Did you ever win any competitions ? 	 I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? 
 I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? 	 I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? 
 I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? 	 Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . 
 Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? 	 We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . 
 That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? 	 A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . 
 Was he disqualified ? 	 Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . 
 Can you ride a horse ? 	 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 
 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 	 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 	 What a good idea ! 
What are you doing ? 	 I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . 
Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 	 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Is it really completely flat ? 	 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 	 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 	 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? 	 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 	 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 	 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 	 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? 	 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 	 First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . 
 How do you research your books ? 	 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . 
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 	 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . 
which countries have you been to ? 	 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . 
 no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 	 I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 isn ’ t it really cold there ? 	 well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? 	 We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . 
 We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? 	 We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . 
 One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? 	 Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . 
 Where have you been ? 	 I just got back from London . 
 How was your flight ? 	 It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . 
 That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? 	 It was 10 hours . 
 Did you have a layover ? 	 Yes , in Paris , France . 
 Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? 	 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! 
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? 	 Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . 
 In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? 	 That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . 
 I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? 	 If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . 
 There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? 	 Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . 
 The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? 	 Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . 
 Is there any pain now ? 	 No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . 
 Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? 	 Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . 
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? 	 I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . 
 How would you do that ? 	 I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . 
Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? 	 Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . 
 The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? 	 It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . 
Is your city a historical place ? 	 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 	 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 	 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? 	 I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . 
 Who ’ s your favourite player ? 	 I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . 
 Do they have a good team ? 	 I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? 	 Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . 
 How many more games are there this season ? 	 We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . 
 What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 	 That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . 
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ? 	 Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . 
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? 	 I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . 
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 	 You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . 
You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? 	 Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . 
 How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? 	 Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . 
 Are you a member of his fan club ? 	 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 	 Of course ! I bought two copies . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 	 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? 	 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 How do I do that ? 	 Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 	 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 	 This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 	 No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
 So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 	 I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? 	 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . 
 How often do you run your anti-virus program ? 	 I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . 
 Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? 	 How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 	 Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
 What do you use your computer for ? 	 I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . 
How often do you use the internet ? 	 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 
 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 	 Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? 	 I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 	 What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . 
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 	 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 	 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . 
Do you believe in god ? 	 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? 	 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 	 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
 For example ? 	 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 	 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 	 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Why does he want to do that ? 	 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 	 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 	 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
Do you think children watch too much Tv ? 	 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
Hi ! What are you watching ? 	 It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 	 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . 
 Why do they go there ? 	 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 	 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 	 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 	 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 	 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 	 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 	 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
Which language do you speak ? 	 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? 	 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 	 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 	 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 	 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 	 Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 	 Who ’ s it about ? 
 Who ’ s it about ? 	 It ’ s about Bob Dylan . 
 Who is he ? 	 He ’ s a famous American musician . 
 Who ’ s the author ? 	 It was written by Howard Sounds . 
 What do you think about it ? 	 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . 
 Can I read it when you ’ re done ? 	 Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 How many chapters does the book have ? 	 There are 15 chapters in total . 
 When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 	 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 What did the critic say ? 	 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
What are you reading ? 	 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 	 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
Are you an art aficionado ? 	 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 	 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 	 Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
How many people are in your family ? 	 As you know , China has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ?

 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 	 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 	 My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 	 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 	 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 How long have you been married ? 	 About seven years now . and you ? 
 About seven years now . and you ? 	 I've been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 I've been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 	 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 	 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 	 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 	 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 	 Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 	 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 	 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 	 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 	 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 	 I want to have a foot massage and haircut . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 	 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 	 That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . 
Are you interested in history ? 	 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 	 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .

When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 	 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 	 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 	 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 	 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 	 Of course . What do you want to move first ?

 How do you want to spend your old age ? 	 In the same way , probably . 
How do you think people get their personalities ? 	 I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . 
 Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? 	 No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . 
 Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? 	 Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . 
 Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? 	 Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends .

 What airline and what flight ? 	 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 .

 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 	 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 	 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ?

 Really ? 	 And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 	 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? 	 I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . 
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 	 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 	 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 	 No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? 	 Around seven . 
 Ok , great , should I bring anything ? 	 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 	 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 	 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 	 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can fill in . 
 Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ? 	 Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Really ? What ’ s the catch ? 	 There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan . 
 So what does this plan include ? 	 Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option . 
 Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? 	 That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... 
Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? 	 You mean Armistice Day . 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 	 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Excuse me ? 	 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 This is it ? 	 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
So , how'd everyone do ? 	 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 
 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 	 Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 	 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 	 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ? 	 Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs . 
What do you think of this one ? 	 Eh , so so . 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 	 Nah , not too flashy . 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 	 I guess . 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 	 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 	 No , please feel free . 
 Do you work in Shanghai ? 	 Yes I do . How about you ? 
 Yes I do . How about you ? 	 No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . 
 You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 	 Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! 
 What was that ? 	 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 And that ? 	 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 What was that ? 	 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 
 Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? 	 Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . 
 What did she mean just now about raising pigs ? 	 Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” 
 Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? 	 No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! 
Is that true ? 	 I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . 
Who's that ? 	 Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . 
 Is that your cousin in the back ? 	 Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . 
 What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? 	 Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 
Harry , do you like the opera ? 	 No , not really . 
What are you two doing in here ? 	 We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . 
 All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? 	 I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... 
 What kind of girl is she ? 	 She's pretty conservative . 
 Is her fiance Taiwanese ? 	 Yes . 
 How old is he ? 	 About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? 
Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 	 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 	 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? 	 You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! 
 Really ? What kind of prizes ? 	 Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! 
 Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? 	 Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! 
 How's business ? 	 Great . We can't keep up with the demand . 
 How about you ? 	 I quit my job as a food critic . 
What's going on here ? 	 We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! 
 Master Li ? Who's that ? 	 He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! 
 Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? 	 Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? 
 Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? 	 Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . 
 Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? 	 Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... 
 He's prejudiced , isn't he ? 	 No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . 
 How's that ? 	 You'll see next week . I'll come by one day at lunchtime . 
Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? 	 Oh , I can't . I have a date ! 
 Really ? Wow with who ? 	 This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . 
 Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? 	 Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . 
 That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? 	 It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . 
 You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? 	 Not only that ! 
Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ? 	 Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies . 
 I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? 	 I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. 
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? 	 He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . 
 When did you start worrying about your weight ? 	 I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 
 I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 	 No , Jess , chill out ! 
 What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? 	 It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . 
 And after church they come here for lunch ? 	 Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? 
 Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? 	 Yeah , what's up with that ? 
 Yeah , what's up with that ? 	 The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 	 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 That's a notebook ? 	 Believe it ! 
 What ? 	 A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! 
 Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? 	 Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die . 
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 	 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? 	 No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! 
 And they said you should play classical music ? 	 How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! 
Are you ready to go shopping ? 	 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 What research ? 	 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 	 But they're just ads ... 
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? 	 Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . 
 What other features are listed ? 	 It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . 
 OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? 	 Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . 
 So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? 	 I guess I'm lending them to you ... 
 Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? 	 Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . 
Where are we headed now ? 	 To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . 
 Awesome . Was someone killed there ? 	 Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . 
 Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? 	 Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . 
Are you sure it was him ? 	 I used to date him . Of course it was him . 
 You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? 	 Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . 
 Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? 	 We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . 
 Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? 	 Maybe ... 
 Is that a kind of alcohol ? 	 It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! 
Does anyone need a drink ? 	 I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? 
 I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? 	 It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! 
 Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? 	 No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? 
 No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? 	 No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . 
Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ? 	 I'm not really into racecar driving . 
 Why ? Are they good ? 	 They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! 
 Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? 	 They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! 
 Why ? Did you open an attachment ? 	 Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . 
Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? 	 No . What did it say ? 
 No . What did it say ? 	 There's a garage sale around the corner . 
 A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? 	 What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? 
 What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? 	 I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! 
 Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? 	 Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . 
 Such a thing exists ? 	 Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! 
He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? 	 I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . 
 True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? 	 Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? 
Wanna chill out and watch cable ? 	 Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? 
 Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? 	 It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . 
 Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? 	 Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? 
What have you been up to , Johnny ? 	 You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... 
 Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? 	 You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . 
 You have all the fun , don't you ? 	 Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . 
 GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? 	 Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts 
 Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? 	 Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! 
Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? 	 Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . 
 Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? 	 No , tell me more . 
You want to go to the movies tonight ? 	 Sure ! What ' s playing ? 
 Sure ! What ' s playing ? 	 The new Twilight movie ! 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 	 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 	 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
Are you excited about your trip next month ? 	 Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . 
 Why ? 	 Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . 
Hey Nick , what are you up to ? 	 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 
 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 	 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 	 Let ’ s do it ! 
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 	 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 	 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 	 January 5th . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 	 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 	 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
What are you doing ? 	 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 	 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 	 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . 
Trina , will you marry me ? 	 Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! 
 She what ? 	 Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . 
 Four hundred ? 	 No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ?

I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? 	 Ah ... 
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 	 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 What was that ? 	 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 	 Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 	 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 	 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 What happened ? 	 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 	 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 	 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 	 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 	 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 	 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 	 Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 	 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 	 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 	 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 	 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 	 It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 	 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? 	 Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . 
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? 	 What do you mean ? 
 What do you mean ? 	 I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . 
 Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? 	 You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 	 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 	 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 	 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 	 Don ’ t count on it . 
 Why would that be funny ? 	 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 Why ? 	 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 Do you have a New Year's resolution ? 	 I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . 
What are you doing , awake ? 	 I can't sleep ... 
 Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? 	 Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! 
 Really ? 	 Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! 
 You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? 	 Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! 
 I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? 	 I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . 
 Where are you going ? 	 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 	 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? 	 Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . 
 Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? 	 My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... 
Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? 	 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? 
 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? 	 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? 
 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? 	 Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . 
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? 	 Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! 
 Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? 	 Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . 
 And then what did happen ? 	 Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . 
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 	 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 	 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 	 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? 	 What do you mean ? 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 For example ? 	 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 	 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 	 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 	 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?

 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 	 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 	 You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
Honey , do you have a second ? 	 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 	 We need to talk .

It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! 
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? 	 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie .

Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system .

Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 	 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Cinct de mayo ? 	 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .

 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 	 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many .

 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 	 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
Where to , miss ? 	 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 	 From China . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 	 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ?

 Is it worth seeing ? 	 Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 
 It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? 	 What's that ? 
 What's that ? 	 Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . 
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? 	 From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . 
 do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? 	 I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . 
 What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? 	 Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . 
Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? 	 I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? 
 I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? 	 Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? 
 Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? 	 No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? 
 No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? 	 I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? 
 I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? 	 I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . 
 Have you been to California ? 	 Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . 
 How many kids do you have ? 	 Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . 
Can I get you something to drink ? 	 No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . 
 I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? 	 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? 
 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? 	 About six years ... 
 What do you do for a living ? 	 I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . 
 Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? 	 That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! 
 Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? 	 I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . 
 So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? 	 They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . 
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? 	 Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? 
 Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? 	 I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . 
 Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? 	 Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . 
 That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? 	 As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . 
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? 	 I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . 
The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? 	 No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? 
 No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? 	 It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . 
 Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? 	 Now you're talking . 
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? 	 Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . 
 The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? 	 It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . 
What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? 	 Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . 
 Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? 	 Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . 
 Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? 	 Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . 
 Why doesn't he just drive to work ? 	 It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . 
 What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? 	 He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . 
How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? 	 Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . 
 Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? 	 Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . 
 Why would you say that ? 	 They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? 	 Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . 
How can I tell her about this ? 	 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 How can you live without job in the future ? 	 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
Why are you in such a hurry ? 	 I should finish it as soon as possible . 
 Why can I learn it ? 	 Don't worry , do it step by step . 
Is that girl your girlfriend ? 	 No , it's not . 
 Two tickets , please . How much are they ? 	 Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . 
 Are these seats okay ? 	 They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . 
How are you getting along with your wife now ? 	 What can you expect ? Not that good . 
 What are you going to do then ? 	 Just let it go . 
 How are your work now ? 	 Not bad , just let it go . 
Did you tip the bellboy ? 	 Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . 
 I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? 	 Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 	 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 And what ’ s the problem ? 	 When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . 
 And you want to know what to wear ? 	 Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . 
 That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? 	 Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 	 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 	 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 	 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 	 I thought we were supposed to meet here . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 	 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 	 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 	 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 	 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 	 No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one 
 Huh ? 	 I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? 	 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . 
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? 	 Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 	 Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 	 Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 	 Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . 
 Why do you say that ? 	 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 	 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 How much do you make ? 	 I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 	 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 	 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 	 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 
Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? 
 I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? 	 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Do you somewhere often , Laura ? 	 Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . 
 Let ’ s go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 	 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 	 I asked if you come here often . 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 	 No , this is my first time here . 
 Gambling ? Where ? 	 Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . 
Do you have much experience with kids ? 	 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 	 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? 	 Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . 
 You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? 	 Actually it will be my first time to meet her . 
 Where will we sleep , then ? 	 In the van . 
 What about other expenses ? 	 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 
 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 	 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? 	 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! 
How is your job search going , Janet ? 	 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 And then what ? 	 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 	 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . 
How good are you at sports , Bill ? 	 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 	 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 	 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
So do you believe in palmistry ? 	 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 	 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 	 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 	 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 	 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 	 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 	 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 	 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 	 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 So what did you do ? 	 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 	 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 	 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 	 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 What'd he do ? 	 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? 	 I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 	 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 	 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 	 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 
Hey , what's new ? 	 Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? 
 Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? 	 Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . 
 What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? 	 Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . 
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 	 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 Why can't we ? 	 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 	 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 Believe what ? 	 You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... 
 What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? 	 To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . 
 Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? 	 No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . 
 Do you go to church regularly ? 	 When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . 
How is the college search going ? 	 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 	 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 And what did the program say ? 	 It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . 
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 	 Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 	 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? 	 I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . 
 You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? 	 Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? 	 I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . 
 Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? 	 Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . 
 How did you get involved in something like that ? 	 Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . 
 So what do you do there ? 	 It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . 
 Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? 	 Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? 
 Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? 	 I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... 
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? 	 Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . 
 Stereotypes ? Like what ? 	 Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . 
Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? 	 Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? 
 Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? 	 Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 	 I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 	 Isn ’ t that complicated ? 
 Isn ’ t that complicated ? 	 No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 	 Sure . I love going to the mall . 
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? 	 No , what ? 
 No , what ? 	 She had to go to the hospital . 
 Why ? 	 She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . 
 Huh ? Me ? 	 Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . 
 Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? 	 Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . 
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 	 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 	 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
What do you do in your spare time ? 	 In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . 
 Do you mind if I come along sometime ? 	 No , not at all . Glad to have you . 
 Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? 	 That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . 
 So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? 	 Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . 
 Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? 	 Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . 
 A house warming party ? 	 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
Can you believe the headlines ? 	 What are you reading ? 
 What are you reading ? 	 I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? 	 He got arrested all right . 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 	 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 	 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 	 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? 	 To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . 
What do you think of the play showed last night ? 	 I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . 
Do you have any plan on your mind ? 	 I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . 
 How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? 	 By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? 
What channel did you watch last night ? 	 Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . 
 You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? 	 It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 
What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 	 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
Did you watch the live telecast of the World Cup last night ? 	 I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert . 
 What's the band called ? 	 Love Music Woman 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 	 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 	 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 	 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 	 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? 	 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .

It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . 
 What about the environmental factors ? 	 Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . 
Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 	 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 	 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? 	 You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . 
 In what ? 	 In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! 
 Can you do the vault ? 	 I do back flips at the pool all the time . 
Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 	 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 	 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 	 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? 	 Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day . 
How do I look in this new dress ? 	 You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . 
 How about this one ? 	 It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . 
 Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? 	 It's fashionable . 
 How ? By drinking ? 	 Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . 
 When did you begin to drink ? 	 It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' 
 And then ? 	 Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . 
Who is it ? 	 Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . 
 Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? 	 Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . 
 What do you want to eat ? 	 Noodles . How about you ? 
 Noodles . How about you ? 	 Dumplings . 
 It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? 	 To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! 
You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? 	 He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? 
 He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? 	 I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . 
Are you ready , honey ? 	 Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . 
 How about transom ? 	 It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . 
Which season do you like best ? 	 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 	 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 	 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? 	 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . 
 How did that happen ? 	 A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 	 Sorry , I have to work overtime . 
Have you ever played Making ? 	 Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . 
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 	 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 	 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 	 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 	 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 	 It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 	 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 	 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? 	 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 	 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . 
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 	 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 	 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 	 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
How long have you been in this company ? 	 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 	 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 	 How regular ? 
 How regular ? 	 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 	 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 	 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
Are you ready to go shopping ? 	 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 What research ? 	 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 	 But they're just ads . 
How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? 	 Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . 
 You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? 	 I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . 
 Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? 	 I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . 
 How's your current job going ? 	 I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . 
 When will we get one of those ? 	 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 	 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 	 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 That's a notebook ? 	 Believe it ! 
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 	 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 What was your childhood like ? 	 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 Where did you go to university ? 	 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 What is your current occupation ? 	 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? 	 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
 The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? 	 First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . 
 Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? 	 From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . 
 You bought a compact car ? 	 No , I borrowed it . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 	 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 Now what are you doing ? 	 Putting on mascara . 
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? 	 Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . 
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 	 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
Any plans tonight ? 	 Not really , do you ? 
 Not really , do you ? 	 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 	 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? 	 Just did my best . 
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 	 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 	 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
 What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? 	 He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . 
 Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? 	 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ? 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ? 	 No problem . See you ! 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 	 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 	 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? 	 You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . 
 I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? 	 You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 	 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 	 Manchester United . What about you ? 
 Manchester United . What about you ? 	 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 	 I have confidence in them . 
Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 	 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 	 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 What do you mean ? 	 I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . 
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 	 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 	 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? 	 China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . 
 Do you import any food items ? 	 Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . 
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? 	 We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . 
 What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? 	 From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! 
 You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? 	 Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! 
 Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? 	 To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . 
 That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? 	 After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . 
 But what ? 	 But he is always talking big . 
 Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? 	 I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . 
 What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? 	 I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . 
 Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? 	 Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . 
 I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? 	 I'm sure management is on top of it . 
 What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? 	 First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... 
 The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? 	 I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . 
 What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? 	 Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . 
 Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? 	 It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . 
How many people are there in your family ? 	 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 That is a big family . How old is your sister ? 	 15 . 
 What about your brother ? 	 He ’ s not quite 25 . 
 Do you miss your family ? 	 Yes . 
 Do you often go home ? 	 No . But I write to them often . 
 How often do you write to them ? 	 Once a month . 
 Yeah . How's everything going ? 	 Not bad . At least I am still alive . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 	 Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . 
 I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? 	 Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . 
 What's the extension number for my phone ? 	 The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . 
 Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? 	 Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . 
Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? 	 Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? 
 Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? 	 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 
 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 	 Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . 
 I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? 	 A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . 
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? 	 Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . 
What is the weather like today ? 	 It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . 
 And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? 	 I missed today's weather for cast in the radio 
Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? 	 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
 Why don't you take a few days off ? 	 I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
How about having a cup of tea with us ? 	 All right.That ’ s very nice of you . 
 Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? 	 I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . 
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 	 Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 	 I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 	 Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 	 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike . 
Hello , Tony . Fancy meeting you here . How are things going with you ? 	 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 	 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 
 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 	 Oh , they are fine . They are enjoying their retirement .

 Why ? 	 People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories .

 What do you think of the ending ? 	 The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . 
So what did you think about the movie ? 	 Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . 
 Why do you think so ? 	 Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . 
 Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? 	 No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . 
 I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? 	 I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one .

 Shall we take a chance ? 	 Yeah , let's do so . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 	 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
What's your hobby ? 	 Photograph . 
 What's the make of your camera ? 	 Olympus . 
 Do you own your own darkroom ? 	 No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . 
 Why ? 	 Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . 
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 	 Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion . 
 How much did you want to spend ? 	 Money is no object . 
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 	 Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .

 Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 	 No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . 
 Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? 	 No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up .

 Wow , isn't that dangerous ? 	 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? 	 It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . 
 You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? 	 You can say that . 
 But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? 	 They must have mixed hackers with crackers . 
 What is crackers then ? 	 There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . 
What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 	 We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River .

 You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? 	 Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . 
 What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? 	 Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . 
 Yes ? 	 Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . 
 I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? 	 Are you serious ? That will be wonderful !

 Do you know what the temperature is today ? 	 I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . 
Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? 	 You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . 
 Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? 	 Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? 
 Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? 	 Darned right I would ! 
 Maybe make-up would be enough ? 	 Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings .

 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? 	 Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway .

 How was it ? 	 Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . 
 Like what ? 	 I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . 
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? 	 I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . 
 Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? 	 Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . 
 Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? 	 Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . 
 Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? 	 Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . 
 To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? 	 Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there .

Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? 	 Yes I am . And you ... 
Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? 	 I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 
Julie , is that you ? 	 Yes . And you're Paul , right ? Paul Hill ? 
 Yes . And you're Paul , right ? Paul Hill ? 	 Yes , it's me . And you're Julie Ashley . How are you ?

 Excuse me ? 	 Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... 
 Who ’ s that boy ? 	 Where ?

 I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ? 	 Sure , why not ?

 Is it expensive ? 	 It is the most expensive . 
 Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ? 	 Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .

 About what ? 	 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 	 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 	 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 	 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 	 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies .

You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . 
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 	 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 What was that ? 	 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 	 Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ?

 Yes , are you ? 	 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 	 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 	 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 	 Good idea . That will help us to warm up .

what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? 	 I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 	 I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . 
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 	 no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? 
 no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? 	 not as far as I know .

 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 	 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .

 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? 	 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .

 Are you a member of his fan club ? 	 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 	 Of course ! I bought two copies . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 	 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films .

 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 	 You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . 
Are you interested in history ? 	 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 	 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .

 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 	 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 	 Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits .

 Do you have a brand preference for anything ? 	 I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . 
 What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? 	 It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it .

 Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 	 Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ?

 Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 	 Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 	 That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ?

 What do you have in mind ? 	 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 	 Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?

 That's the Return of the King , right ? 	 Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 	 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 	 No . did you ? 
 No . did you ? 	 Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
Hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? 	 Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 	 Whatever you prefer . 
 This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? 	 Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 
 Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 	 Sure , what do you have ? 
 Sure , what do you have ? 	 I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . 
 So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? 	 There's just going to be 6 of us tonight . 
 Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? 	 Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . 
Which language do you speak ? 	 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 	 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 	 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 	 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 	 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 	 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 	 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout 
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 	 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns .

 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 	 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 	 Let ’ s do it ! 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 	 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 	 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 	 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 	 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 	 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 	 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 	 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 	 January 5th . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 	 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
What are you doing ? 	 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 	 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 	 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 	 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 	 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop .

Hello , John . How are you ? 	 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 	 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 	 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 	 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 What have you been doing ? 	 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 	 They're both very well , thanks . 
 Where are you going now ? 	 I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me ? 
 I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me ? 	 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 	 Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 
 When do you leave ? 	 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 	 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 	 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Why not ? 	 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 	 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 	 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 	 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 So what can we do ? 	 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 Days ? 	 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
Hi . What's up ? 	 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 	 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 What is a tornado warning ? 	 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 	 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 What do you mean " a loud train " ? 	 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 	 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 	 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 Did it hit their house ? 	 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 What were they doing when you called ? 	 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 	 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 What happened ? 	 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 	 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 	 Hehe .. sure 
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? 	 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 
 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 	 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 
 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 	 Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . 
 It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? 	 Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 	 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 	 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 
 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 	 Yes , I ’ m a singer . 
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 	 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? 	 What do you mean ? 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 For example ? 	 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 	 It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 	 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 	 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 	 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 What is that ? 	 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 	 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 	 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 	 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 	 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 	 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
Can we talk ? 	 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 	 You know what I mean . 
 You do ? 	 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? 	 Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 
Where to , miss ? 	 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 	 From China . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 	 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 	 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 	 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 	 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 
 What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? 	 Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . 
 It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? 	 Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . 
Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? 	 Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . 
 Oh ... why ? 	 Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . 
 Sure . What is it ? 	 Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? 
 Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? 	 Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! 
 I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? 	 I ... I ... 
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? 	 Of course . Are you a new member here ? 
 Of course . Are you a new member here ? 	 Yes . 
 Do you have any experience using weights ? 	 No , I don't . So I need some help . 
 Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? 	 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? 
 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? 	 I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . 
 We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? 	 Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . 
 Three or four o'clock ? 	 Yes . 
 But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? 	 Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? 
 Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? 	 Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . 
 What is that they're doing on the couch ? 	 They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . 
 Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? 	 Yes , it is . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . 
 I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? 	 I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . 
 Why don't you run outside ? 	 Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? 
 Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? 	 Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . 
 You ? 	 Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . 
 Are you laughing at me ? 	 I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . 
 I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? 	 It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... 
 What ? 	 I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . 
 Nervous ? Why ? 	 I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . 
 Alright . But will we sing ? 	 Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . 
 And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? 	 No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . 
 Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? 	 That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . 
 Sure . What is it ? 	 I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . 
 I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? 	 I am worried about the meeting this morning . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . But what are you worried about ? 
 Yes . But what are you worried about ? 	 I'm afraid I was too rude . 
 Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? 	 Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . 
 Really ? 	 Yes . 
 You mean because you are a woman ? 	 Yes . And he is the president of the company . 
Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? 	 No , I don't think so . 
 Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? 	 No . It's no problem.Are you American ? 
 No . It's no problem.Are you American ? 	 Yes . And you ? 
 Yes . And you ? 	 No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? 
 No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? 	 Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . 
 Are you flying home ? 	 Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . 
 You were visiting Taiwan ? 	 No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . 
 Yes . Why not ? 	 May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? 
 May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? 	 Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? 
 Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? 	 Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? 
 Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? 	 I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . 
 No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? 	 No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? 
 Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? 	 He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . 
 Where will it be ? 	 We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . 
 Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? 	 Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . 
 The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? 	 It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . 
 Mom ? 	 Yes , honey ... 
There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? 	 I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . 
 Why ? 	 Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . 
 Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? 	 I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . 
 What was that ? 	 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 And that ? 	 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 What was that ? 	 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! 
 Why would that be funny ? 	 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 Why ? 	 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 	 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 	 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 	 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 
Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? 	 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 	 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 	 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Is he ok ? 	 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 	 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 	 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 What are you so excited about ? 	 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 	 No , how much is it worth ? 
 No , how much is it worth ? 	 About 80 million dollars . 
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 	 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 What ’ s the score ? 	 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 	 Right . 
Who are those guys ? 	 Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 	 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 	 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 How hard is the climb ? 	 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 What did you do last week ? 	 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 	 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 	 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 	 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
Hey man , what do you have on tap ? 	 Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . 
 Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? 	 Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . 
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 	 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 	 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 	 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 	 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 	 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 	 I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . 
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? 	 Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! 
 Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? 	 Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . 
 This one ? 	 That ’ s my index finger ! 
 Oh , right . This one , right ? 	 Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . 
Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? 	 At the drop of a hat . 
What's bothering that guy ? 	 Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? 	 When pigs fly ! 
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? 	 I just took a shot in the dark . 
How was your business trip ? 	 Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
Did you understand question number three ? 	 Not at all , I was totally in the dark . 
 You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? 	 Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? 
 Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? 	 No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? 
 No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? 	 Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . 
 Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? 	 Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . 
 That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? 	 Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . 
Will you be at the family reunion next year ? 	 Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! 
Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? 	 I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . 
 Fifty times ? 	 Yes , it was really stupid . 
 And how much did it cost to rent it ? 	 It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . 
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? 	 Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . 
 What are you planning to do today ? 	 I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . 
 Have you done windsurfing before ? 	 No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . 
 Can you take a little advice from a friend ? 	 Sure . What ? 
 Sure . What ? 	 Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . 
 Which guy ? 	 The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . 
 I can't see him . Where ? 	 Right there . 
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? 	 I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? 
 I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? 	 I can't do that . 
 Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? 	 Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . 
 So how much do you want to gamble ? 	 Maybe 500 dollars . 
 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? 	 I don't want people to think I'm stingy . 
Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? 	 You can buy some of these nice butterflies . 
 What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? 	 Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . 
 How much are they ? 	 This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? 
 This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? 	 If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? 
 If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? 	 Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . 
So how much should I gamble ? 	 Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? 
 Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? 	 Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? 
 Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? 	 I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . 
 So what do you want to play then ? 	 Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . 
... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? 	 Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . 
 You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? 	 But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . 
Why did she do that ? 	 I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 	 He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 	 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 	 Yeah ? 
 Yeah ? 	 That ’ s my brother ! 
 Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? 	 I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . 
 Ahahah ... really ? 	 Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? 
 Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? 	 Hey , I offered last year ... 
Has the game started yet ? 	 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 Who's winning ? 	 The Bulls , of course ! 
 That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? 	 Perfect ! 
 What is it ? 	 I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 	 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? 	 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! 
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? 	 Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
 Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? 	 Oh ... I don ’ t know . 
 Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? 	 Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . 
What do you want to do tomorrow night ? 	 What--is tomorrow night something special ? 
 What--is tomorrow night something special ? 	 It's Friday . We should go party . 
 Do you feel like dancing ? 	 Yes ? Why not ? 
 Yes ? Why not ? 	 Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . 
 So where should we go ? 	 Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . 
 The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? 	 It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . 
 It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? 	 Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . 
 It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? 	 Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . 
 Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? 	 Maybe . 
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 	 Oh , hey ... 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 	 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 	 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 	 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? 	 Oh , yes , it was very interesting . 
 What were the schools like ? 	 Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . 
 But you taught children , yes ? 	 Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . 
 They actually study after school ? 	 That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . 
 Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? 	 Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . 
 Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? 	 That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . 
 Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? 	 I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? 	 No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . 
 Why do you say " have to " ? 	 Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . 
 Do you want me to give you a ride ? 	 No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . 
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? 	 No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . 
He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? 	 You can't judge a book by its cover . 
 Really ? Who did you hear that from ? 	 Just word of mouth . 
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? 	 No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
 What do you mean ? 	 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 	 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
What ’ s your city like ? 	 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 	 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 	 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 	 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
Is your city a historical place ? 	 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 	 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 	 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 
Do you believe in UFO's ? 	 Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 Do you think that there's life on other planets ? 	 I think there must be . 
 Why is that ? 	 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 	 No , but we're trying to contact them . 
 Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 	 There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? 	 yeah , I can find enough online . 
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? 	 Awful . It was a complete waste of time . 
 Why ? What was it about ? 	 It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . 
 Sounds good . Where are we going ? 	 Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . 
 Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? 	 Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! 
 Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? 	 My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . 
 ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? 	 I've fallen in love with my boss . 
 really ? Is he married ? 	 no , of course not . He is still single . 
 then what's your problem ? 	 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? 	 Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . 
 Quite a difference , huh ? 	 Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . 
 how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ? 	 oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn 
how's it going ? 	 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 	 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 what's wrong ? 	 there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 	 sure , but how ? 
 sure , but how ? 	 you can ask her out for drink after work . 
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? 	 yes , it is .

 is everything ready now ? 	 almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .

 are you doing anything this weekend ? 	 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 are you available on Sunday ? 	 yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .

 that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 	 it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 what should I bring with me ? 	 we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 do you like surfing ? 	 I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? 	 we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 	 you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 ok , where and when should I meet you ? 	 we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !

 when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 	 the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .

 how so ? 	 he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .

Did you enjoy that new movie ? 	 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 	 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 	 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 	 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
excuse me ; is this seat taken ? 	 no . It's all yours . 
 the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? 	 it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming .

 where are you from ? 	 I'm from China . What about you ? 
 I'm from China . What about you ? 	 I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . 
 did you enjoy it ? 	 I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? 
 I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? 	 it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . 
 Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? 	 yes , have you read it ? 
 yes , have you read it ? 	 no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? 
 no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? 	 well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . 
Hi , Mike , what gives ? 	 Hi , Bill , this is my new car . 
 You like it , huh ? 	 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 
 It is special , isn't it ? 	 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 	 Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 	 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? 	 Jump in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 	 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 
 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 	 A little , I wish I could do that . 
 How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? 	 Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . 
 How so ? 	 He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . 
 Have you talk to him about it ? 	 Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night 
 Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? 	 He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . 
 True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? 	 I'll get you for that comments , George . 
 Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? 	 ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . 
 What's the problem ? 	 My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . 
 Yeah , and ? 	 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! 
 Why ? 	 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . 
 So how long has he here for ? 	 Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . 
 good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 	 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! 
 what's that ? 	 well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 	 just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 is there anything else bothering you ? 	 just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 do you have any other plans this weekend ? 	 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
wow ! You're going to Tibet ? 	 yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . 
 great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? 	 nothing particular . 
 ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? 	 the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . 
how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 	 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 	 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 	 taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? 	 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . 
 well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? 	 where is that ? 
 where is that ? 	 not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . 
 what's there to see ? 	 there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . 
hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? 	 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
 oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? 	 we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec 
 tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 	 perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . 
 yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 	 great , let's go ! 
 are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? 	 never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 
 never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 	 yeah , I think so . 
hey , Mary , what's up ? 	 not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 	 well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a 
 it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 	 there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h 
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 	 no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 	 what about a factory tour ? 
 what about a factory tour ? 	 you mean visit a factory ? 
 you mean visit a factory ? 	 yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 	 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 really ? What do the companies do that for ? 	 I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 do we need an appointment beforehand ? 	 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? 	 oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 and then ? 	 take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 by the way , how long does it take ? 	 without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? 	 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
it's a lovely day , isn't it ? 	 yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 is she American ? 	 yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 	 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 	 not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 	 you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 	 it was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? 	 yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . 
 what else did you see ? 	 art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 	 yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 	 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? 	 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
who are you writing a letter to ? 	 I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? 
 I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? 	 OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . 
 that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? 	 well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . 
 you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? 	 just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . 
 shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? 	 ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! 
 what would you do without me ? 	 we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 
Have you heard about the new iPhone ? 	 yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? 
 yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? 	 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . 
 how big is a shuffle iPod ? 	 the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . 
 how many gigs of music can it hold ? 	 I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . 
 how much do they cost ? 	 not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . 
 do you have an iPod ? 	 I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . 
 why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? 	 that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 
what are you looking for ? 	 I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . 
 do you know what camcorder options are available ? 	 not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . 
 would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? 	 sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . 
 ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? 	 it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? 
 it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? 	 it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . 
 can you also take still photos with this ? 	 yes , that is an option . 
 how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? 	 yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . 
 that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? 	 It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . 
 how does that compare with other models ? 	 there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . 
what's up ? 	 not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . 
 what's wrong ? 	 I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . 
 Are you using dial-up or broadband ? 	 actually , I've got a wireless connection . 
 do you like ever chat online ? 	 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? 
 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? 	 Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . 
 what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? 	 well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . 
 what's that ? 	 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! 
 have you read it yet ? 	 no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . 
 when did you send her a letter ? 	 just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . 
 are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? 	 didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . 
Is that your phone ? 	 yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 	 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 	 yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 	 yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? 
 yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? 	 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 does it have a camera ? 	 of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? 
 of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? 	 I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . 
 have you checked your voicemail recently ? 	 no , why ? 
 no , why ? 	 I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . 
 do you want to listen to your messages first ? 	 no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . 
 I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? 	 it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . 
 how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? 	 it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! 
do you like playing games ? 	 I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . 
 how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? 	 the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! 
 how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? 	 I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! 
 do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? 	 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 
 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 	 I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! 
how did your interview go ? 	 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 	 if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 will you get a pay-raise , too ? 	 whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 	 my boss . 
 what kinds of questions did she ask you ? 	 she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 	 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 those are good answers . How did she react ? 	 she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 what do you think about her as a boss ? 	 she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? 	 sure . 
 first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? 	 well , you are a very hard-worker . 
 there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? 	 I could really use a 5 % rise . 
 that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? 	 of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . 
do you mind if I sit here ? 	 no , of course not . Go ahead . 
 don't I know you ? 	 yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . 
 What did you do after high school ? 	 I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? 
 I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? 	 I took a year off to go travelling . 
 that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? 	 I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? 
 I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? 	 I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . 
 Oh , did you study a foreign language ? 	 yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . 
 that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? 	 it is , but it's very rewarding . 
 so you can speak Chinese ? 	 I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! 
hello . Where are you headed today ? 	 I'm off to Barcelona for a week . 
 do you have your passport with you ? 	 yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 
 yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 	 fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . 
 would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 	 are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 
 are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 	 let me see here ... yes , there's one left . 
 alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 	 I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
 if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 	 yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 
 yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 	 you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 
 don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? 	 sure . 
 the train ? Will I be flying back then ? 	 oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . 
 will the train be very crowded ? 	 oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . 
 when is the first meeting then ? 	 they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower . 
 where will I be staying ? 	 we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . 
 that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 	 that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 	 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . 
 where are you planning on going ? 	 I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? 
 I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? 	 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 would you recommend going there for a few days ? 	 personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? 	 it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 	 I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . 
welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 	 it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 where did you end up going ? 	 because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 	 that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 	 sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 sure . What's this one a picture of ? 	 oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 so what did you do ? 	 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 	 of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 
hi , how are you doing ? 	 everything's great . And you ? 
 everything's great . And you ? 	 same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? 	 no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . 
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? 	 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . 
 Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? 	 Yeah , a number of times . 
 oh , why ? 	 I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . 
 well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? 	 I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . 
 what do you mean ? 	 you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . 
 a left girl ? What's that ? 	 they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , 
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 	 why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 why ? Did tom pop the question ? 	 not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 	 you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 oh , how did you deal with it ? 	 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 	 simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 like what ? 	 he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? 	 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 	 but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . 
 BYOB ? What's that ? 	 bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . 
 hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? 	 pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . 
 that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? 	 well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don 
hi , Natasha , how's life ? 	 great . My family came to visit me . 
 oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 	 my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 	 yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 	 the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da 
 do you get along well with each other ? 	 yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? 	 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 
 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 	 yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! 
 why ? 	 I can see five other guys eying her up . 
do you have internet in your room ? 	 sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . 
 really ? What do you usually do online ? 	 well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . 
 really ? Who do you chat with ? 	 to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were 
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? 	 just after 2 am . 
 what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? 	 nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . 
 really ? What is it ? 	 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? 
 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? 	 I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? 
 I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? 	 I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c 
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? 	 well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . 
 oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? 	 actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? 
 actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? 	 art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . 
 how often do you go to the cinema ? 	 once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . 
 movie salon ? where is that ? 	 it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . 
 is it good ? 	 yes , you can find almost all new releases there . 
 is it a horror movie ? 	 yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 	 no way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? 	 alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 	 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 	 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 really ? Where did you hear that ? 	 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 	 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 	 it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 	 of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 when did you learn to dance ? 	 in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 	 it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 how about tango ? 	 oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 	 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . 
 isn't there anything else ? 	 I have no idea . 
 oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 	 let's go ! 
 thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 	 oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . 
what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 	 to be honest , I wouldn't . 
 why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 	 not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 what's the puzzle ? 	 my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 	 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 what would it be like ? 	 well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 how many rooms would it have ? 	 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t 
 how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? 	 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 how would you decorate your house ? 	 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b 
 how many TVs would your dream home have ? 	 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 	 no problem . 
 do you know how to set the timer ? 	 let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . 
 did it come out ? 	 yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . 
 are they window seats or aisle seats ? 	 let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . 
 thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 	 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
is this seat taken ? 	 no . please sit down . 
 are you also going to Beijing ? 	 yes , on a business trip . How about you ? 
 yes , on a business trip . How about you ? 	 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 	 yes , I went there once last summer . 
 really ? What did you think ? 	 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 was it that crowded ? 	 yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . 
Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ? 	 Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . 
 Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? 	 Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 Where were you ? 	 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 	 it's got to be almost a year now . 
 how have you been ? 	 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 	 not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 	 Mrs . Thou ? 
 Mrs . Thou ? 	 yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
what's your apartment like ? 	 it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 what is it like living in on-campus housing ? 	 it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 did you have to pay a deposit ? 	 no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 	 no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 how long is your contract for ? 	 that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 have you started looking again yet ? 	 not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 	 no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 can't you hang out with them , too ? 	 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 	 my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 	 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 	 my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t 
 that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 	 we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 	 not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
Mary , how was your date with john ? 	 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 	 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 	 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 	 he didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 	 come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 how did you meet each other ? 	 she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . 
 is this your first date ? 	 yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . 
 oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? 	 absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! 
 then who will you meet tonight ? 	 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . 
 really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? 	 please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 	 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 why did you lie to me in the email ? 	 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 	 waiting for someone . 
 you mean the boy you met on MSN ? 	 you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 did you tell him ? 	 yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 	 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 	 they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 	 sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . 
 how about drinking soda ? 	 many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try 
 that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 	 my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 how do you know so much about food and dieting ? 	 you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 do you have any other symptoms ? 	 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 	 just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 	 yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 	 no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 how did you get that burn again ? 	 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 	 no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 when's the last time you took your tablets ? 	 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 	 just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 	 that sounds good . 
 do you feel ok ? 	 not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . 
 could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 	 you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
 Zach , what's that on your arm ? 	 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . 
 it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 	 just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . 
 shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 	 we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . 
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 	 sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 	 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 	 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 	 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 	 they'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 that depends . What is it ? 	 it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans 
 that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? 	 how about at 6 pm ? 
 how about at 6 pm ? 	 see you then ! 
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 	 of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 of course . Is the dinner still on ? 	 yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 	 when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 has anything else happened to you ? 	 nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 
does your family have a record of your ancestors ? 	 sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . 
 that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? 	 I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . 
 are you very close to your first-cousins ? 	 the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . 
 I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? 	 it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . 
 that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? 	 at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . 
Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? 	 Actually , i popped in them last night . 
 OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? 	 Well , they're really beautiful people . 
 I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? 	 Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . 
 What did you mean ? 	 I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . 
have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 	 no . what's it like ? 
 no . what's it like ? 	 it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through 
 would you want to live there ? 	 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro 
 what's your dreamhole like then ? 	 my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . 
 would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 	 old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? 	 no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 	 no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a 
Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? 	 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
 I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? 	 She made another white crack about my clothes . 
 Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? 	 Of course , I am sure . 
 Just how am I supposed to do that ? 	 You shall just take it in surprise . 
 Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? 	 I am not . she is no picnic . 
How many people are there in your family ? 	 There are 15 people in my family . 
 What did you say ? How many ? 	 15 people .

hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? 	 everything's great . I've just returned from my office . 
 your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? 	 sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . 
 a virtual office ? 	 yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . 
 what kind of services do they offer ? 	 a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . 
 sounds fun.what else ? 	 I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . 
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? 	 Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . 
 In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? 	 My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . 
 Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? 	 No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho 
 It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? 	 That's a great idea ! 
Can you play baseball with me today ? 	 No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow .

 It was a good game , wasn't it ? 	 Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . 
 How did it finish ? 	 It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 
 It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 	 It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . 
 Did your wife enjoy it ? 	 No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book .

Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? 	 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . 
 Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? 	 Certainly . 
Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? 	 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? 
 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? 	 He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish 
 Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? 	 School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . 
 Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? 	 No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . 
 What does he do when it rains ? 	 My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . 
 What happened ? 	 I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . 
 Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? 	 My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . 
I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 	 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
Guess who I saw yesterday ? 	 I don't know . Who ? 
 I don't know . Who ? 	 Avril Lavigen ! 
 the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 	 yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 so you're a big fan , eh ? 	 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . 
 and she was in a movie once again , right ? 	 yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 	 she looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 did you take a photo with her ? 	 no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . 
 How are you doing ? 	 I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? 
 I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? 	 Nothing special . 
 I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? 	 Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . 
Julie , what's on the tube ? 	 nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . 
 oh , what is it ? 	 it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . 
have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 	 yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 what ? 	 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 what is it ? 	 some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 that makes you feel uncomfortable ? 	 yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 	 yeah . 
hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 	 not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
 Really ? What's the series about ? 	 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 	 sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
 as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 	 to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . 
 anything strang about that ? 	 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . 
 what was the prize ? 	 I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . 
 that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? 	 I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . 
what kind of music do you like listening to ? 	 I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?

 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ? 	 I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea . 
 that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? 	 that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . 
 you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? 	 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 	 he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 	 no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 
How are the children doing at sport ? 	 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . 
 He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? 	 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi 
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 	 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . 
 How are they at swimming ? 	 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . 
how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 	 well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up .

 What do the Romans do ? 	 They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk .

 Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 	 We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .

 Like what ? 	 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone . 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 	 No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 	 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August .

 That sounds good . What's the charge ? 	 The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print . 
 That sounds good . Now , how about the other alternatives ? 	 Of course . Our lobby is set up for wireless , so just bring your computer down here . 
 Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ? 	 They plan to install a printer here . But until then , you'll have to use the lab . 
 Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ? 	 The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing . 
 Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? 	 Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs .

 What would you like ? 	 I'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 I'm sorry . We're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 	 I'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do . 
 And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 	 Normally , I would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight .

 Great ! How much is it for a copy ? 	 The price per copy is ten cents . 
Can I order something from the kitchen ? 	 Just tell me what you'd like , please . 
 I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 	 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! 
 Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ? 	 Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries . 
 Could you be a little more specific , sir ? 	 Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo . 
 I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ? 	 Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here . 
 So , what's the problem ? 	 I need souvenirs ! 
 By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? 	 You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . 
 Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ? 	 No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . 
 I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? 	 I need to take home some souvenirs ! 
 Are you kidding ? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ? 	 No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . 
Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? 	 I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . 
 Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? 	 What am I going to do about souvenirs ? 
 What am I going to do about souvenirs ? 	 Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! 
 Great ! How much per copy ? 	 Sir , one copy is ten cents . 
 Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? 	 No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . 
 I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? 	 What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? 
 What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? 	 Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! 
 Amenities ? What do you mean by amenities , sir ? 	 Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc . 
 I see . Sir , if I may ask . Have you used up all the amenities in your room ? 	 Not at all . I still have enough for the next few days . 
 Then what is the problem , sir ? 	 I need some to keep as souvenirs ! 
 Souvenirs ? 	 Yes , souvenirs . Trinkets to remember my trip by ! 
 Fantastic ! Is there a charge ? 	 It's ten cents a copy , sir . 
Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ? 	 Sir , you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab .

 May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ? 	 Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course . 
 If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? 	 This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . 
 Very good . How much does each copy cost ? 	 Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . 
 Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? 	 Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . 
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 	 Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . 
 Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? 	 Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer . 
I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ? 	 But of course ! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner ?

 I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ? 	 The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap .

 How many rolls altogether ? 	 Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . 
 Six weeks , did you say ? 	 Yes , five to six weeks . 
 Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? 	 What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . 
 Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? 	 That's right . 
 When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? 	 As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . 
 Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? 	 We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . 
What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? 	 Cartons . Is that okay ? 
 Cartons . Is that okay ? 	 I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . 
 You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? 	 We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . 
Could I have a word with you , Madam ? 	 Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . 
 So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? 	 I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . 
 That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? 	 I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . 
 I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? 	 I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . 
Can you effect shipment during September ? 	 I don't think we can make it . 
 Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? 	 By the middle of October . 
 Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? 	 Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . 
 Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? 	 Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . 
 Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? 	 Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . 
 Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? 	 This afternoon . 
What do you think about the equipment in our company ? 	 We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . 
David , how is your interview ? 	 I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 
 I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 	 Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
 Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 	 Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 
 What can I do next ? 	 The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . 
 Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? 	 Maybe we should call its after-service man . 
How much tea are you going to order ? 	 We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . 
 When do you want to deliver the goods ? 	 We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . 
 Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? 	 Right . 
How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? 	 Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . 
 In what way can we solve the problem ? 	 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? 
 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? 	 Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . 
 What about a draft at 120 days sight ? 	 All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . 
How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? 	 What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? 
 What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? 	 We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . 
 No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? 	 Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . 
 Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? 	 That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order . 
To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? 	 First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . 
 Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? 	 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 	 Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? 
 Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? 	 Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . 
Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? 	 OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? 	 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? 
 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? 	 When do you want me to come ? 
 When do you want me to come ? 	 Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . 
Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? 	 Sure , what's the matter ? 
 Sure , what's the matter ? 	 As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . 
 What do you think we can do about this ? 	 We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . 
 Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? 	 Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . 
I have read your resume.What is your last job ? 	 I've worked in the Production Department for two years . 
 Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? 	 Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % . 
 Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? 	 Yes . I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University . 
 Why are you willing to work for our company ? 	 I can get more promotion in your company . 
In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? 	 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? 
 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? 	 How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 
 How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 	 I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . 
Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ? 	 What's wrong ? We have been working overtime recently . 
 Must we finish our task before the holiday ? 	 Yes . The contract must be kept . 
 Did he say why ? 	 He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday . 
 Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? 	 Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . 
 I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? 	 Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . 
 So how do you intend to do that ? 	 OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . 
 May I interrupt you for a moment ? 	 Go ahead . 
 How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? 	 Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . 
 I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? 	 Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . 
Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ? 	 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? 
 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? 	 I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . 
 Really ? When will she come back ? 	 Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left .

Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? 	 This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? 
 This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? 	 Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
 Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 	 We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . 
 Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? 	 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? 	 Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . 
 Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? 	 I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . 
Janice , the president of our company , Mr Smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . Are all the members notified ? 	 Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone .

 What's the meeting for ? 	 It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 	 You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? 	 I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . 
Bell Computers Limited , can I help you ? 	 Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . 
 Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? 	 Yes , can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? My name's Mary , and I'm calling from Happy Travel . My number is 123 456 789 . 
 Sorry , could you repeat that please ? 	 Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ? 
 Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ? 	 Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can .

 The first is why you choose our company ? 	 I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement .

 Why are you interested in working with this company ? 	 One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for 
Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? 	 I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . 
 I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? 	 Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 	 Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . 
 Have you applied for work with any other companies ? 	 Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed . 
 If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ? 	 This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . 
Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? 	 Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . 
 Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? 	 The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . 
 What did you take as your major in college ? 	 I took Accounting as my major . 
 What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? 	 I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . 
 All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? 	 There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible . 
Madam , is everything set up for your trip ? 	 Not yet . I seem to move my house to that place . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this trip . 
 You will be busier , right ? 	 Correct ! I have three-day visit to Shanghai on December 10th . 
 I would like a single room with a bath for two nights . Can you help me to reserve a hotel room for me ? 	 Yes , Madam . 
 When can I contact you about your final decision ? 	 We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not .

I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology .

 Do you enjoy your work ? 	 To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work . 
 Anything else ? 	 She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . 
 Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ? 	 Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . 
Is this the first time you've come to our city , Mr . Ross ? 	 Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company . 
 I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ? 	 That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . 
 May I call you at your home about our final decision ? 	 Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon .

How can I help you , sir ? 	 I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
 Sorry , could you tell me your name ? 	 I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
 Do you have an appointment ? 	 Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . 
 I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 	 Thank you . 
Here I raise a question for you . Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan . Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ? 	 Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate . 
 Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ? 	 It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group . 
 And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ? 	 Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know . 
Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? 	 I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . 
What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? 	 Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way .

 Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? 	 Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . 
 Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? 	 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? 
 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? 	 Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? 	 Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . 
 OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? 	 Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . 
 Can we add up this item to the agreement ? 	 Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ?

 Is there anything special they would like to do ? 	 They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . 
 That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ? 	 They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . 
 Which terms ? 	 First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . 
 Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? 	 As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . 
 Do you have some points to bring up ? 	 Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here .

We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? 	 As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . 
 Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? 	 Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . 
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 	 If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . 
 Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? 	 Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . 
Good morning . What can I do for you ? 	 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? 
 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? 	 This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . 
 Can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? 	 With pleasure . It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . Besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on .

Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ? 	 I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting .

 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 	 I think I am extroverted .

David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? 	 Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . 
 Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? 	 To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . 
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? 	 We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . 
 If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? 	 I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . 
Have you finished that report yet ? 	 No . I'm still working on it . 
 How much time do you need ? 	 Give me one more day . 
Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? 	 Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 	 It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . 
 Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? 	 I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . 
 My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? 	 Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? 
 Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? 	 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . 
 But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? 	 It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . 
 Well , can you explain it to me ? 	 The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . 
 Can you reduce more ? 	 I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . 
Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ? 	 Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? 
 Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? 	 Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 	 We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive . 
 What are your terms of payment ? 	 Letter of credit at sight . 
 Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ? 	 Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us . 
 Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? 	 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . 
 Impossible . How about 5 % off ? 	 Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . 
 Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? 	 In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . 
We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? 	 Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . 
 I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? 	 I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . 
 What about the cost of delivery ? 	 We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B . 
How about the repair fee ? 	 It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . 
 Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? 	 They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . 
 I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? 	 That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . 
 OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? 	 Yes , I'll talk to her . 
Why are you quitting ? 	 I've had enough . 
 Are you having a meeting ? 	 Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted . 
 I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ? 	 Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ? 
 Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ? 	 Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number .

 These are your products ? 	 They are our products . Please come in and have a look . This is the catalogue for our products . 
 Would you sit down and write down your name and address here ? 	 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? 
 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? 	 This is the latest design for our products . The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way . The sales volume of the new product is about 50,000 per month . And we received many orders from many clothes companies . New functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products . 
Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 	 Yes , I need to talk to him .

You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? 	 Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . 
 Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? 	 It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . 
 Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? 	 Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . 
 Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? 	 Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . 
What are you doing , Janice ? 	 I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work 
 Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? 	 Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . 
 You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? 	 I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . 
 Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? 	 Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . 
 How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? 	 15 years . 
Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? 	 Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . 
 I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? 	 Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . 
May I speak to Marry ? 	 She's in a meeting until noon . 
 Could you put it in detail ? 	 Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . 
 What kind of media do you recommend ? 	 I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . 
You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ? 	 I like it very much . 
 If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ? 	 No , I don ’ t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax . 
 Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ? 	 I ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . My boss only pays lip service . 
 What is your salary expectation for this position ? 	 My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RIB range . That ’ s the take-home pay . 
 OK . Have you seen the samples ? 	 Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . 
 What's your price ? 	 150 yuan for each piece . 
 How about 130 yuan ? 	 I offer you 110 yuan . 
 All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? 	 If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . 
What kind of personality do you think you have ? 	 I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . 
 What makes you angry ? 	 Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable . 
How was your interview ? 	 Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . 
 What did you say ? 	 I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . 
 Did he want to know the reasons ? 	 Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . 
 That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? 	 In a couple of days , I was told . 
 Sure . What's your date of delivery ? 	 I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . 
 What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? 	 We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . 
 Can you deliver them earlier ? 	 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? 
 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? 	 Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . 
What are your personal weaknesses ? 	 I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . 
 Are you more of a leader or a follower ? 	 I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . 
 Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 	 Yes , in most circumstances . 
 Are you available for travel ? 	 Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Yes , Marry ? 	 I just wanted to let you to know that we had decided to offer the sales position to someone else . 
Why have you stopped production ? 	 We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off . 
 OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? 	 I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed . 
 All right . What time are you coming ? 	 Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ? 
 Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ? 	 Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 . 
All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ? 	 Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . 
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 	 Perhaps one year , I'm not sure . 
 You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 	 I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . 
 I understand . When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 	 Please let me check . Tomorrow afternoon - Yes , he'll be free from 2:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 
 Please let me check . Tomorrow afternoon - Yes , he'll be free from 2:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 	 Yes , that's quite all right for me . 
 Yes , Mary ? 	 I'm afraid we're really staffed this week , Mr . Li . I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't . 
 Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ? 	 Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week . 
 How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? 	 OK , I'll go to your office at that time . 
I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ? 	 Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 . 
 How long will the sub contractors be on site ? 	 About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan . 
Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ? 	 I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? 
 I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? 	 Let me check . It's 3.80 m . 
 Are you sure that's high enough ? 	 That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . 
How's the building work going ? 	 Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . 
Who's in charge of the construction project ? 	 We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ?

In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? 	 I can ’ t I'm afraid . I've got another meeting scheduled for 2:30 p . m . 
I'm phoning about the factory visit next Friday . What should I do when I arrive ? 	 Park in the visitors ' car park in front of the factory and then go to the gatehouse . It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park . The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge . My assistant will come down to meet you . 
 That's excellent . How have you managed that ? 	 Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . 
 What does that mean exactly ? 	 Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . 
 What other sources of energy do you use ? 	 We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . 
Have you always been on this site ? 	 No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . 
 Why did you move ? 	 We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . 
 Do you have many different suppliers ? 	 Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . 
Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ? 	 We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . 
 That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? 	 No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . 
How do you choose which companies to work with ? 	 Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . 
What do you do ? 	 I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . 
 Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? 	 Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .

You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . 
 Why did you pick this organization ? 	 I'm very much interested in the position . 
 What made you decide to join our company ? 	 I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours .

It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 	 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 	 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
How many people does your company employ ? 	 We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot .

How long has the company been in business ? 	 For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds .

Why have you changed your job so frequently ? 	 My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . 
 Good . Anything else ? 	 Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . 
Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ? 	 Yes .

 Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? 	 No , thanks . 
This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 	 I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . 
Where are you employed ? 	 I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . 
 What do you think of your present job ? 	 I find it interesting . 
 How do you get to office ? 	 I go to the office by bus every day . 
 What does your work consist of exactly ? 	 My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . 
 Would you mind working overtime at night ? 	 No , often my boss requires overtime work . 
 How much money are you making a month ? 	 5,000 yuan a month . 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 	 I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . 
 Why do you want to resign ? 	 As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . 
 What kind of work are you interested in ? 	 Just as you advertised in the newspaper . 
Hi , Paulo . How are things going ? 	 Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . 
 That's good news . What stage are you at now ? 	 Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? 
 Why ? 	 Mr . Chen can't make it today . 
Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? 	 Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . 
 Have all the operators been trained on it ? 	 Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . 
 How long will the system be down for ? 	 We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . 
How many places have you worked altogether ? 	 Three . 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 	 I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . 
 What time do you go to work ? 	 I must be there no later than 9:00 . 
 What time does the office close ? 	 I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . 
 Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? 	 No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 	 I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . 
 When was it serviced ? 	 Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . 
 What's actually wrong with it ? 	 Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . 
I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? 	 Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . 
 So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? 	 That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . 
 Is there anything you don't do in-house ? 	 Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . 
 Is that more expensive ? 	 It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . 
Are you doing the job the way I suggested ? 	 No , I think I didn't like your method . 
Where can I find a spare hose for the pump ? 	 What size do you need ? 
 What size do you need ? 	 25 mm diameter . 
 Thanks . Have you got any light bulbs ? 	 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? 
 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? 	 Oh yes , some wire cutters . 
 I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ? 	 Just one pair . 
I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? 	 It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . 
Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? 	 Sure , but I have to finish this report first . 
 Sorry , what do you mean ? 	 When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder . 
Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ? 	 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? 
 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? 	 Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . 
 I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? 	 Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood . 
 Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment . Could we increase it by about a third ? 	 Sure . So let's see . We need a piece of wood 3.5 m long by 1 m wide . I'll order it right away and I'll be able to install it next Tuesday . 
Has my package arrived ? 	 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? 
 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? 	 It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . 
 What's going on over there ? 	 They're setting up the machine for a new run . 
 How long does that usually take ? 	 About twenty minutes . 
 What's happening at the far end ? 	 That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . 
 Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ? 	 It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . 
 What does the unit consist of ? 	 Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . 
 What's the running speed of the machine ? 	 About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . 
 And what's the maximum output ? 	 If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . 
Is the factory fully-automated ? 	 Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
 What about supply of parts to the production line ? 	 Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . 
 What about the smaller components ? 	 They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 
Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? 	 Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . 
 So , is it actually paper at this stage ? 	 Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . 
How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? 	 We try to recycle as much as we can . 
 What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? 	 We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . 
 But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? 	 Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill 
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? 	 Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . 
 What about your use of raw materials ? 	 Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . 
 What happens if you exceed the limits ? 	 We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . 
 Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ? 	 I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ? 
 I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ? 	 This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? 
 This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? 	 He'll be back at about five in the afternoon . Could I take a message ? 
 He'll be back at about five in the afternoon . Could I take a message ? 	 Yes , Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible . It's about the PPT contract . 
Good morning . May I help you ? 	 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . 
 But Could you tell me when he will be back ? 	 I am sorry , I don't know . 
 well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? 	 Certainly . 
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? 	 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? 
 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? 	 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . 
 When do you leave ? 	 I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . 
 Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ? 	 I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here . 
 I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ? 	 Let me check my diary . Er . I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday . I've got to go to Beijing for a conference . I'll come back on Thursday . 
 That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ? 	 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? 
 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? 	 Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? 
 Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? 	 Yeah , that's fine . Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel . I'll look forward to it . 
Excuse me , but are you Mr . Smith from Britain ? 	 Yes , I am . 
 Did you have a good trip ? 	 On the whole , not too bad . 
 How long did the meeting last ? 	 The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . 
 Did the chairman ask for me ? 	 Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . 
 All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? 	 Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . 
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? 	 No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . 
Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? 	 Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . 
 What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? 	 First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . 
 I see , and how about the documents and the information ? 	 All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . 
 And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? 	 Of course , she should take minutes . 
 And after the meeting ? 	 After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . 
Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ? 	 Certainly , Mr . Baker . 
 Could you please double space it so I can make corrections ? 	 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? 
 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? 	 No . This afternoon will be fine . 
 For wood or for metal ? 	 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? 
 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? 	 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? 
 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? 	 Yes , quite free until noon . 
 You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? 	 Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . 
Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? 	 Of course , Mr . Green . 
 OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ? 	 Please type it in a formal style . 
 I see . Anything else ? 	 No , thanks . 
Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ? 	 We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider . 
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? 	 We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . 
 What about the packaging ? 	 We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . 
Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ? 	 I cut it on that blade . 
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? 	 They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . 
 Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? 	 Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . 
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? 	 Yes , it's definitely a growing business . 
 What do you recycle in your plant ? 	 Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . 
 How is plastic recycled , then ? 	 Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . 
 Is that the method you use here ? 	 No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . 
 How do you do that ? 	 By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . 
 Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? 	 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? 
 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? 	 This is John Laing from Dantons . 
 Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? 	 Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . 
 Certainly . Does she have your number ? 	 She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . 
 Just a moment ... I'm afraid there's nobody there right now . Could I take a message ? 	 Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments .

 Thank you . And the message ? 	 It's about an invoice which is wrong .

 How do you spell that ? 	 M , A , double R , I , O , double T . 
Fastback Travel . How can I help you ? 	 Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ?

 Could you leave him a message ? 	 Sure . 
 Right , I think I've got that . OK , what's the message ? 	 Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it . 
 Could you spell that please ? 	 Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T . 
 How often do you service the vans ? 	 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . 
 I see . What does the service involve ? 	 Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . 
 Can you carry out major repairs here ? 	 Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ?

We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . 
 How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? 	 Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! 
What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? 	 It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . 
John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 	 I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .

She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . 
 Well , what about price ? 	 The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries .

Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . 
 Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? 	 Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . 
What is your greatest strength ? 	 I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time .

Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . 
 How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? 	 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later .

Your definition on success ? 	 Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . 
 What ’ s your ideal job ? 	 Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . 
 How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? 	 Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . 
 How would your present boss describe you ? 	 He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . 
 What would your colleagues say about you ? 	 They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . 
What's your ideal boss ? 	 I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . 
And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? 	 Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . 
 Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? 	 No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . 
 What's your strong points ? 	 Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . 
 What do you dislike most about your job ? 	 Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . 
 What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? 	 A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . 
 Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? 	 Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . 
 How do you feel about overtime work ? 	 That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . 
 What is most important to you in a job ? 	 I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . 
 Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? 	 I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . 
 Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? 	 Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . 
 OK . What are your strong points ? 	 Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . 
 And your weaknesses ? 	 I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . 
How do you get along with your boss ? 	 I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . 
 What do you think is important in your work ? 	 Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . 
I've heard that you are going to call for a tender . What kind of goods would you like to buy ? 	 Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory .

China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? 	 It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . 
 We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? 	 Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies .

The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . 
What do you think of our price ? 	 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 	 Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? 	 We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
 Is that all ? 	 Yes this is the best we can do . 
What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ? 	 I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account .

 Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 	 Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . 
 Have you had any experience with computer ? 	 Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . 
 That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? 	 I can handle them without any trouble

My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . 
 What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? 	 First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . 
I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? 	 That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores .

 Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? 	 All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .

 What's your proposal then ? 	 I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . 
 We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? 	 As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . 
 What's your counter-offer then ? 	 To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help .

 Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? 	 When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient .

 OK . What ? 	 It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor . 
 You wouldn't do that . Would you ? 	 I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . 
 You do ? How are you going to contact him ? 	 I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . 
 What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ? 	 He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . 
 Can I spy on you guys from the window ? 	 No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince . 
 So you knew it was me ? 	 I had an idea . 
 So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? 	 My mind is made up . 
 I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? 	 Right . The faint of heart should not apply . 
 Like who ? 	 Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . 
 You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? 	 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? 
 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? 	 That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . 
Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? 	 That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . 
Who has been here already this morning ? 	 Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . 
 Who else has been here ? 	 Elvin stopped by to see me . 
 Who told you that ? 	 That doesn't matter . I want at least 4 percent . 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 	 Exactly . 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 	 How ? 
 How ? 	 Because I won't let it fail .

Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 	 What do you need ?

 What do you mean ? 	 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
What is your most preferred training method ? 	 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 
 Well , that is also very efficient , right ? 	 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . 
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 	 No , really ? 
 No , really ? 	 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 Who will be there ? 	 James is going to be packed off there .

 Anything that distracts you from work ? 	 Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . 
 Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? 	 Well , I will try . 
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? 	 If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . 
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 	 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 	 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 	 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 	 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company .

Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? 	 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 	 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen PM . Do you have a projector in your room ? I would like to show you some related charts 
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 	 What is the problem ?

Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 	 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 	 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that sound ? 
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday .

 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 	 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 	 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 	 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 	 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 	 Yes , please .

 Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? 	 They should have then listed on their resumes . 
 And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? 	 Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .

 How ? 	 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use .

There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 	 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 	 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . 
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 	 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .

With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? 	 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? 
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? 	 Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . 
 So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? 	 In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . 
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? 	 I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . 
 Good . Do I have a second ? 	 I second . 
 motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? 	 I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left .

 Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 	 Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .

How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 	 Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week .

We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . 
 What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? 	 Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . 
 Why is the price so high ? 	 It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .

Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ?

 And what is the most important point ? 	 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 	 That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . 
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 	 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . 
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 	 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 	 Yes , it is not easy . 
Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 	 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 	 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . 
Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 	 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 	 Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two .

 Why , what's the lowdown ? 	 According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . 
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? 	 Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 
 Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 	 Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager . 
How come it is slow as a snail today ? 	 You mean the network connection ? 
 You mean the network connection ? 	 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . 
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? 	 No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . 
 You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? 	 The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . 
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 	 Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
 Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? 	 I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . 
Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? 	 From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . 
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? 	 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? 
 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? 	 Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . 
 Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? 	 I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . 
 So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? 	 I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . 
 Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? 	 That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . 
How did your company's fundraiser go ? 	 The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . 
 So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 	 Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . 
What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? 	 We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . 
 What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? 	 It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . 
 For example ? 	 For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . 
 Good news for us . When can you start to work ? 	 It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . 
 Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? 	 In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . 
 What kind of considerations are we talking about ? 	 It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . 
 Our company now has n ombudsman ? 	 Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . 
Are you free next thursday ? 	 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? 
 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? 	 A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . 
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? 	 Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . 
 Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? 	 Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? 
 What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? 	 Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . 
 What can I do for you ? 	 I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? 
 I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? 	 Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . 
 Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? 	 We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . 
 So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? 	 We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . 
How often are stockholders meetings held ? 	 Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . 
 So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? 	 Unless they're united , very little ... 
 You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? 	 Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . 
 What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? 	 No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . 
 How many people are on the board of directors ? 	 Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . 
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? 	 Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . 
 What's he studying ? 	 He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . 
 Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? 	 The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . 
 Why is that ? 	 He just has his secretary do his homework for him . 
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? 	 Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . 
 But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? 	 Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . 
 It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? 	 Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . 
Francis , what ’ s that ? 	 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 	 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . 
 How many departments do we have ? 	 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 	 Mr . White , too . 
So , where can I start my work ? 	 Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . 
 And I represent ? 	 Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . 
Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? 	 Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . 
 So , what experience do you have ? 	 I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . 
 I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? 	 I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . 
 I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? 	 I would rather work full-time . 
 I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? 	 I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . 
How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? 	 It is 15 minutes ’ drive . 
 What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? 	 Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . 
 Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? 	 Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . 
 It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? 	 Yes , at the end of the hall . 
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? 	 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... 
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? 	 There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . 
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? 	 We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . 
 No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? 	 We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . 
 Are you kidding ? 	 No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... 
 Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? 	 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? 
 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? 	 No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . 
How can I help you ? 	 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . 
 Do you have an appointment ? 	 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . 
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? 	 Sure . 
 Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 	 That would be very nice . Thank you . 
 What news ? 	 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 You know what we will get ? 	 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station .

Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave .

 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 	 Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? 
 Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? 	 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 	 You can send a compressed one . 
Did you hear something ? 	 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 	 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 	 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 	 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
What are in this folder ? 	 They are reports of our company . 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 	 No , they are filed according to dates .

 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 	 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 	 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 	 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 	 Should each of us write separately ? 
 Should each of us write separately ? 	 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 	 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 	 Have a seat please while I call . 
How long have you been in this company ? 	 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 	 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 	 How regular ? 
 How regular ? 	 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 	 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? 	 Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . 
 To visit our supplier ? 	 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 	 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 	 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 	 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? 	 It was a nightmare . 
 What ’ s up ? 	 Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . 
 Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 	 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . 
 This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 	 I am still waiting for their call . 
 If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? 	 I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . 
 Can I see it for a second ? 	 Sure , here it is ... 
 Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? 	 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? 
 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? 	 I don't think so , why do you ask ? 
 I don't think so , why do you ask ? 	 The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... 
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 	 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . 
 Like this one ? 	 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . 
Can you help me for a minute ? 	 Sure , what I can do for you ? 
 Sure , what I can do for you ? 	 I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person . 
 OK , So I first thanks them for their business , I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , How is that ? 	 Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . 
 Right , do you need them to respond ? 	 Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? 
 Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? 	 You can tell them " Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience . 
So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? 	 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 
 What was so bad about it ? 	 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . 
Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 	 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 	 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 	 From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 	 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 	 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? 	 That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . 
 How long will the tour take ? 	 It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . 
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? 	 We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . 
 OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? 	 I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . 
 What about that one ? 	 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? 
 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? 	 You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . 
May I help you ? 	 Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time . 
 Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ? 	 It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A . 
 Yes , Mr . Smith . I have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ? 	 Yes . 
 Is there the correct billing address ? 	 No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 .

 What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? 	 Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
 Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? 	 There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week .

It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 	 My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
 When do you find a job satisfying ? 	 My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
 How would your coworkers describe you ? 	 First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . 
 Do you have any questions ? 	 Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 
How would you describe your ideal job ? 	 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .

What kind of person do you think you are ? 	 Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 	 Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . 
 What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? 	 To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . 
 How do you spend your leisure time ? 	 I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . 
 So , what kind of sport do you like most ? 	 Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . 
 Would you tell me something about your family ? 	 There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker .

 What happened ? 	 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career !

I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .

 That bad , huh ? 	 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever .

What type of people do you work with most effectively ? 	 I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . 
 What things impress you in your colleagues ? 	 I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . 
 What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? 	 The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . 
 How do you organize and plan for major projects ? 	 I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . 
 How do you manage your time in a typical day ? 	 I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . 
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? 	 Yes . But he is meeting a client . 
 Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? 	 I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes .

I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best .

David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? 	 Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . 
 Ok . What else ? 	 They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? 
 They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? 	 I see . What about the salary ? 
 I see . What about the salary ? 	 Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . 
Anything else ? 	 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?

 You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? 	 To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on 
 interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? 	 That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail 
 Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? 	 I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled 
 I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? 	 Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . 
 What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? 	 I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . 
 So the company will pay for everything ? 	 Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . 
 That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? 	 I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . 
Comfort Inn , may I help you ? 	 I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . 
 You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? 	 Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 
 Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 	 During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in 
 That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? 	 I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards . 
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? 	 Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design 
 I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? 	 Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t 
 That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? 	 Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . 
Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ? 	 Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . 
 Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? 	 No . 
 Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? 	 Not at all . Go right ahead . 
 What ’ s this sir ? 	 It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . 
 What are these red things sir ? 	 Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . 
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? 	 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years . 
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? 	 I see myself in a management position . 
 Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? 	 It ’ s L-e-e . 
 You mean I have to pay now ? 	 Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta 
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 	 Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . 
 I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 	 Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , 
 So who has to stay behind ? 	 Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . 
 Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? 	 Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . 
Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? 	 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? 
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? 	 The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . 
 What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? 	 That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . 
 Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? 	 Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . 
 Do you want the large size , or the small size ? 	 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? 
 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? 	 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? 
 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? 	 Yes , please . And I want some glue . 
 I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? 	 No , thank you . 
 Is that all ? 	 That's all , thank you . 
 What else do you want ? 	 I want my change . 
 Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? 	 Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . 
Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 	 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? 
 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? 	 I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form 
 I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? 	 Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . 
 OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? 	 Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . 
 Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? 	 Yes , that ’ s correct . 
 Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? 	 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . 
 Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? 	 Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . 
 Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? 	 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . 
 May I see your ticket please ? 	 Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? 	 Any form of picture I . D . will do . 
 Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? 	 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? 
 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? 	 Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? 
 Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? 	 Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? 
 Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? 	 Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . 
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? 	 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . 
 When do you plan to travel ? 	 I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . 
 Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? 	 Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . 
 I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? 	 I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . 
 When would you like to return ? 	 My return date will be the 14th . 
 OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 	 Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! 
 Will there be any layovers ? 	 No , all flights are direct . 
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? 	 $ 800 dollars . 
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? 	 So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . 
 Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? 	 I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? 
 I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? 	 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 	 It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . 
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? 	 I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? 	 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 	 It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . 
 This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? 	 Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . 
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 	 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 	 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 	 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 	 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . 
 you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 	 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ? 	 Can ’ t complain . And you ? 
 Can ’ t complain . And you ? 	 Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? 
 Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ? 	 Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday . 
Do you mind if I smoke here ? 	 Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . 
 Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? 	 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? 
 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? 	 It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . 
 Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? 	 Oh , no problem . 
have you finished going through the contract ? 	 yes , but I have a few questions for you . 
 even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? 	 that ’ s correct . 
 do you have any other questions ? 	 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? 
 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? 	 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . 
 how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? 	 men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . 
 why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? 	 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? 
 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? 	 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? 
 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? 	 yes , please . 
do you have a minute ? 	 sure , what would you like to discuss ? 
 sure , what would you like to discuss ? 	 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . 
 well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? 	 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . 
 can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? 	 oh , no . not at all . 
 are you planning on studying abroad ? 	 no , sir . 
 have you been given a better offer ? 	 Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . 
 well , what's the problem then ? 	 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . 
how was your day ? 	 let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? 
 let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? 	 it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . 
 did you get to leave early then ? 	 my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . 
 let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? 	 it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . 
 you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? 	 I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . 
 what ’ s that ? 	 I got sacked today . 
 you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? 	 well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . 
 how late were you ? 	 only about 5 minutes . 
 you got fired for being a few minutes late ? 	 my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . 
Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? 	 What ’ s to get ready ? 
 What ’ s to get ready ? 	 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 	 Nope . 
 Have you updated your CV ? 	 Nope . 
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? 	 sure . What do you need ? 
 sure . What do you need ? 	 well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . 
 really ? Why ? 	 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . 
 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? 	 the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . 
 I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? 	 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . 
are you ready for the meeting ? 	 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? 
 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? 	 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . 
 how's your assistant manager getting on ? 	 well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . 
 what seems to be the problem ? 	 well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . 
 if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? 	 to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . 
hello ? 	 good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 is there someone else I can talk to ? 	 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 	 any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 	 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 	 that will be fine . 
hi , Isaiah . How are you ? 	 I ’ m well . And you ? 
 I ’ m well . And you ? 	 fine . How ’ s your job going ? 
 fine . How ’ s your job going ? 	 I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . 
 really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? 	 I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . 
 how ’ s it going ? 	 it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! 
 that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? 	 our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . 
 where will those be located ? 	 if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . 
 when will you find out ? 	 we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . 
how's your new job going ? 	 really well , thanks . 
 how are you finding your new boss ? 	 she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . 
 would you rather have her or your old boss back ? 	 she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 how about your new co-workers ? 	 they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 do you miss your old co-workers ? 	 of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 do people in different departments get along with each other ? 	 sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . 
 do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? 	 yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 
 do you like working in teams ? 	 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
how's your job search going ? 	 I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? 	 I've only found a few openings in my field . 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 	 I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . 
 there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? 	 unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . 
 that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? 	 yes . 
 really ? what is it ? 	 it's a job at a recruitment agency . 
 that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? 	 well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! 
 that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? 	 sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! 
 let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 	 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 	 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Late night ? 	 Yeah , I got home around two . 
Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 	 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? 	 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 	 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 	 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 	 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? 	 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 	 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 	 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 do you have experience in the IT field ? 	 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 do you speak Spanish ? 	 yes , but not fluently . 
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? 	 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 	 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? 	 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? 
 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? 	 everything has been fine for the past several months . 
 sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? 	 as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . 
 can you think of anything else ? 	 sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . 
How's your job search going ? 	 I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 have you finished compiling your resume ? 	 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? 
 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? 	 that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . 
 good . How about your cover letter ? 	 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? 
 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? 	 no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of 
 thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? 	 sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . 
 yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? 	 you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil 
 then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? 	 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview 
 are there any other things I should pay attention to ? 	 yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . 
Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? 	 I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . 
 why ? 	 many say more development opportunities can be found there . 
 one person ? How about your girlfriend ? 	 oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . 
do you have s second ? 	 sure . What do you want ? 
 sure . What do you want ? 	 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 really ? Why ? 	 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 	 yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received 
What did you do at the office today ? 	 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 	 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 	 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 	 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? 	 no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . 
 why is that ? 	 well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . 
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? 	 Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al 
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 	 Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . 
Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 	 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 	 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so 
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 	 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
 I see . And how about the working hours ? 	 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 	 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 
Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? 	 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 So , what changed ? 	 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? 	 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 	 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 	 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 	 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 	 Yes , please . 
Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? 	 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? 	 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? 	 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? 	 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . 
 Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? 	 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . 
 What did that involve ? 	 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 
 I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? 	 Yes , okay . 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 	 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really 
hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? 	 sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . 
 I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? 	 I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . 
 is it ok to include the pictures ? 	 definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . 
 ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? 	 that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s 
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? 	 hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . 
 so what happened in the meeting ? 	 one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . 
 may I make a suggestion ? 	 sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . 
What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? 	 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 	 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 	 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 What else do you suggest ? 	 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th 
We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? 	 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 	 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 	 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 	 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su 
What ’ s your working day like ? 	 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 	 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 Do you have any breaks ? 	 We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 	 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 	 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 	 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . 
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? 	 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 	 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . 
 When will the branch office open ? 	 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . 
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 	 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . 
 Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? 	 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . 
 That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? 	 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . 
 How often do you have meetings ? 	 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee 
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? 	 I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . 
 That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? 	 That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . 
Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? 	 Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . 
 Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? 	 No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . 
can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 	 That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . 
Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? 	 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? 
 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? 	 Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . 
 Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? 	 Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . 
 Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? 	 I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . 
Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ? 	 Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . 
when are you going to give me those brochures ? 	 What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . 
Hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ? 	 The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? 
 The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ? 	 Yes , I pretty much understand the company . 
 Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ? 	 Yes , I've been observing them . 
 When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ? 	 I already have something to wear . 
 I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ? 	 OK , I am ready to think of other things . 
 Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? 	 No , I probably need to do some more research . 
 When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? 	 I think that their attitude is rather casual . 
 So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? 	 I have absolutely nothing so far . 
 You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? 	 Yes , where should we go from here ? 
 Yes , where should we go from here ? 	 Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . 
Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? 	 Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . 
 Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? 	 I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . 
 Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? 	 I want to grow in my job and move ahead . 
 Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? 	 I need to stay in the area because of my family . 
 How much do you need to make per year ? 	 75,000 per year . 
Can you help me plan the office party ? 	 Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? 
 Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? 	 I need help with food . 
 OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? 	 I think it should be casual . 
 I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? 	 I would prefer Chinese food for this party . 
 Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? 	 I think we should hire a live band . 
Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? 	 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? 
 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? 	 Tuesday would be good for me . 
 OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? 	 I think the afternoon would be best . 
 Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? 	 I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . 
 Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? 	 Yes , I know how to get there on my own . 
 Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? 	 I would like to meet on Monday . 
 Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? 	 I want to come in the morning . 
 I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? 	 Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . 
 Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? 	 I think that we should have just the sub-committee . 
 OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? 	 No , I need directions , please . 
Will you tell me the situation ? 	 I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . 
 And then ? 	 I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . 
 I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? 	 Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 	 Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
 Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 	 No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
 No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? 	 Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
 Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 	 No . It's been empty the whole time . 
 I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? 	 No . My friend did . 
 Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 	 No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . 
 I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? 	 Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . 
 Should I call the police ? 	 You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
Oh , my God ! What's this ? 	 What ? 
 What ? 	 Look ! This window is open . 
 Did you open it before we left ? 	 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 	 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? 
 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? 	 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . 
 But what if someone's still up there ? 	 I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? 
 I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? 	 Not really . 
 Do you know where they're vacationing ? 	 I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . 
 Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? 	 Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . 
Hi ! What are you watching ? 	 It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting .

 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 	 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 	 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
Are you watching another news report about the war ? 	 Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . 
 How did this war start ? 	 Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . 
 What do you think will happen ? 	 Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . 
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? 	 We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . 
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 	 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 	 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro

 Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? 	 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . 
 What ’ s a cabinet ? 	 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . 
 Can any mp make a law ? 	 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .

 Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? 	 I'm not quite sure . 
 Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? 	 No , I have no idea what you are talking about . 
Can you help me with my timesheet ? 	 Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ?

Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 	 It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 	 I don't think that there is any easy way . 
How do you think they could be ended ? 	 I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . 
 Where have you been ? 	 My car broke down . 
 Do you know which channel it is on ? 	 Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms . 
 I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? 	 We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for . 
 Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ? 	 You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you .

 what happened to him then ? 	 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 did they take his license away ? 	 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 what do you think will happen to him ? 	 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? 	 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one .

 Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? 	 Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time .

 Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? 	 I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . 
 Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? 	 No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . 
Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? 	 I need some advice about my fixed deposits .

 Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? 	 Yes ... 
Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? 	 Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ?

 I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? 	 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? 
 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? 	 Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ?

 How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? 	 Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . 
 OK , what does that entail ? 	 It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . 
 Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? 	 Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . 
 I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? 	 Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .

Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? 	 I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . 
 Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? 	 Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . 
 I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? 	 Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % 
 So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? 	 We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . 
Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? 	 My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . 
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? 	 What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . 
 Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? 	 Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . 
 What do you require ? 	 A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? 	 I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . 
 Have you invested in the stock market before ? 	 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . 
 Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? 	 Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . 
This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? 	 Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . 
 We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 	 Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . 
 That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 	 Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . 
Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? 	 I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . 
 Are you an existing customer ? 	 Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . 
Credit Services , how can I help you ? 	 I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . 
 Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? 	 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 	 Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . 
 Why such a big difference ? 	 It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . 
 My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? 	 Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . 
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? 	 Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . 
 Really ? 	 Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . 
 So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? 	 Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . 
 How so ? 	 For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . 
Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? 	 Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . 
 Is there anything else ? 	 There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . 
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? 	 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . 
 I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? 	 Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . 
 I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? 	 That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . 
 I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? 	 The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . 
Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? 	 I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . 
 How so ? 	 Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . 
 I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? 	 I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . 
Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? 	 Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . 
 Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? 	 May I have your details , and I'll check for you . 
Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? 	 I think so . 
 What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? 	 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? 
 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? 	 As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . 
Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? 	 I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . 
 I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? 	 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? 
 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? 	 That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . 
 Could I open an account with you today ? 	 Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . 
 Yes , here you go . And sign here ? 	 Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . 
IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ? 	 Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . 
 Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? 	 No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . 
 It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? 	 Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now . 
Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? 	 Speaking . 
 Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? 	 Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . 
 I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? 	 That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . 
How can I help you this afternoon ? 	 I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter . 
 You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? 	 I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card . 
Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? 	 This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . 
 Shall I come in and collect it ? 	 Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . 
Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 	 Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 	 I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . 
 Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? 	 No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! 
 You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? 	 Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? 
 Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? 	 Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . 
Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? 	 I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . 
 No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? 	 Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . 
 I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? 	 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . 
 That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? 	 OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . 
 It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? 	 That's fine . OK . Thanks . 
Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? 	 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? 
 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? 	 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? 
 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? 	 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! 
 How much would you like to withdraw ? 	 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? 
 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? 	 That's fine . 
Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? 	 I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? 
 I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? 	 That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . 
 A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? 	 A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . 
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ? 	 I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? 
 I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? 	 Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . 
 No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? 	 A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . 
I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? 	 Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . 
 I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? 	 It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . 
Welcome to IBA . Do you need any assistance ? 	 Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . 
 We offer many different payment plans . Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? 	 Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . 
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? 	 I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you . Please take a seat , I won't be a minute . 
May I help you at all ? 	 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? 
 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? 	 We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . 
 So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? 	 That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . 
Good day ! What can we do for you ? 	 I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . 
Personal Loans , how may I help ? 	 I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . 
 Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? 	 Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . 
 I see . What about age limitations ? 	 There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . 
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 	 Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . 
 OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? 	 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? 
 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? 	 You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . 
Did you need help with something ? 	 I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . 
 How can you help me ? 	 I work here . 
 May I see your ID ? 	 Here it is . 
 What do I do now ? 	 Go to a voting booth and vote . 
Are you planning on voting ? 	 Yes . What about you ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 	 Yes , but this will be my first time voting . 
 Really ? 	 Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . 
Are you going to vote ? 	 I am . Are you ?

 Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? 	 Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . 
 Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? 	 Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . 
Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? 	 Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . 
 Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? 	 Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . 
 Then it'll give me my money ? 	 Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . 
 Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? 	 Yes , then enter the amount you want .

 Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? 	 The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . 
 And the maximum loan amount ? 	 The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral .

 Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? 	 Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . 
 What if I exceed ? 	 If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . 
 Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? 	 It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . 
 So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? 	 First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . 
Hi , how can I help ? 	 I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit .

Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? 	 No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago .

 Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? 	 Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . 
 This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? 	 No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it .

 So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? 	 That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . 
Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ? 	 There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . 
What can I do for you , Madam ? 	 Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?

 Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? 	 Well , everything really . 
Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? 	 Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?

Good afternoon , Mr Meng ! It's nice to see you today . It's been a while , hasn't it ? 	 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . 
 I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ? 	 I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week . 
 Right . Do you have the code for that one ? 	 It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? 
 It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? 	 Here it is . Have you got the advice slip with you ? You have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead . 
 Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? 	 Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? 
 Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? 	 Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . 
 What's the difference between the two ? 	 If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . 
 Then how about the current account ? 	 You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . 
 OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? 	 Yes . 
Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? 	 Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment . 
 I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ? 	 Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount . 
Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 	 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? 
 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? 	 L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . 
Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ? 	 I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . 
 OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? 	 Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . 
Hello . Is everything OK , there ? 	 I'm having a little trouble with this form . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 	 There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want . 
 So , I should choose that one ? 	 I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form . 
 I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ? 	 Yes , that's all in order . Let's get this processed for you , then . 
Good afternoon . May I help you ? 	 Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . 
 Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? 	 I prefer time deposit . 
 Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ? 	 RIB deposit . 
 Is it your first time to make a deposit here ? 	 Yes . 
 The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? 	 Six months . 
Hello . What can I do for you today ? 	 I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong . 
 Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? 	 Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . 
 Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? 	 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? 
 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? 	 Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . 
Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 	 I want to effect payment under an L / C today .

Hello , welcome to the International Business Counter , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 	 Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C . 
 Of course . Is there a problem with them ? 	 Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . 
Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ? 	 Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods . 
 Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? 	 Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . 
Hello again . What can I do for you today ? 	 Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . 
 Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? 	 That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? 
 That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? 	 Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... 
Good morning , Mr Bell . How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ? 	 Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 . 
Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? 	 You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived ? It's Ming Cha Legal Services . 
 JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? 	 Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? 
 Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? 	 Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . 
Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? 	 I am indeed . What can you tell me ? 
 I am indeed . What can you tell me ? 	 The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . 
 Do I get a card ? 	 Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . 
 That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? 	 Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . 
Hello , there . What can we do for you today ? 	 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? 
 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? 	 Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . 
 I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? 	 Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . 
 What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? 	 Certainly , Sir . Via phone or Internet , any time , any place . 
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? 	 The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! 
 I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? 	 I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . 
 And for the Savings Deposit ? 	 For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . 
Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? 	 Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . 
Hello , Madam . What can we do for you today ? 	 Hi . I've been sent over from Turner Interiors . They said I need to collect some sort of L / C ? Do you have it ?

 It should be from Sayuri Beds . Is that right ? 	 Yes , it is . Sayuri Beds , Tokyo , Japan . 
 That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ? 	 Just sign right here , please . That's everything you need to do .

 OK , when will this remittance arrive ? 	 Generally it will arrive within a week . 
 That's good . Is there anything else ? 	 No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . 
Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? 	 Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . 
 Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? 	 I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . 
 That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? 	 We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . 
 Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? 	 Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . 
Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? 	 Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . 
 That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? 	 Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . 
 What is it , Mrs . Wang ? 	 It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . 
 Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? 	 Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . 
Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 	 Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . 
 How much do you want to change ? 	 I am not sure . What's the rate today ? 
 I am not sure . What's the rate today ? 	 It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . 
 What was the rate yesterday ? 	 The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . 
 It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? 	 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? 
 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? 	 I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . 
When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? 	 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 	 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? 	 No . These terms need to be amplified . 
 What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? 	 Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . 
 Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? 	 By the coming September . 
 Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? 	 Certainly ! 
 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? 	 We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? 	 In April or early May . 
 How much would you like ? 	 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . 
 What's the problem ? 	 The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . 
What's your main range ? 	 Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . 
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? 	 I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . 
 What are they ? 	 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? 
 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? 	 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? 
 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? 	 The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel .

 What's your last word as to the date then ? 	 I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . 
 Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? 	 How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 	 It's FOB Shanghai . 
 Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? 	 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? 
 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? 	 Okay , see you tomorrow ! 
Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? 	 Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business .

The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries .

Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . 
 Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 	 Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade .

 What's the interest rate ? 	 It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . 
 How do I go about taking it out ? 	 Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . 
Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? 	 Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
 Just a moment , please . Your name ? 	 Emily Smith . 
I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? 	 I'd be glad to . 
 Do you have an account with this bank ? 	 I'm afraid not . 
 What is the interest rate on your card ? 	 The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . 
 How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? 	 You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . 
 Does the card provide any other benefits ? 	 You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . 
Hello , may I help you ? 	 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? 
 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? 	 Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . 
 Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? 	 Ok . 
 Do we need to put on the jackets too ? 	 You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . 
 Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? 	 Well , not fully automated . 
 I see . How do you control the quality ? 	 All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . 
 What ’ s the monthly output ? 	 One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . 
 What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? 	 About 2 % in normal operations . 
 That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? 	 Yes . Shall we take a break now ? 
How large is the plant ? 	 It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . 
 It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? 	 In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . 
 How many employees do you have in this plant ? 	 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . 
 Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? 	 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? 
 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? 	 That ’ s fine . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? 	 Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . 
 That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? 	 500 pieces . 
 Do you sell direct to shops ? 	 Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . 
 Do you keep a stock of these things ? 	 In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . 
 According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? 	 We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . 
 Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 	 Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . 
 Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? 	 Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? 	 What is your proposal ? 
 What is your proposal ? 	 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . 
 What would you suggest ? 	 The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . 
 What is it ? 	 My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . 
 I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? 	 Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . 
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? 	 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 	 Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . 
 As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? 	 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? 
 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? 	 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . 
 Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? 	 Tomorrow afternoon . 
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? 	 We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . 
 That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? 	 Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . 
 Is that including tax ? 	 No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . 
 How much is your profit margin then ? 	 Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . 
 We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? 	 Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . 
 How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 	 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . 
 Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 	 I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
 I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 	 Very well , I will . 
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 	 As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . 
 The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? 	 To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . 
 Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? 	 Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? 
 Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? 	 Good . Friday morning at 9 . 
May I help you ? 	 Yes , I would like to exchange some money . 
 what currency would you like to trade in ? 	 I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 
 I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 	 No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? 
 No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? 	 Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? 
 Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? 	 It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? 
 It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? 	 I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! 
So how did I do ? 	 Not too good , I'm sorry . 
 I lost ? 	 It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . 
 So the price was good ? 	 Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . 
How much will our order from your factory be ? 	 I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . 
 I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? 	 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? 
 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? 	 Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . 
 Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? 	 Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . 
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? 	 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? 
 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? 	 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? 
 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? 	 I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . 
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? 	 We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . 
 So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? 	 Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? 
 Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? 	 Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . 
 Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? 	 Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . 
 You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? 	 I could , but where's the fun in that ? 
 Than you , I'm not late , am I ? 	 No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? 	 Please , I wish you would . 
 Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? 	 No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . 
 Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? 	 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? 
 I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? 	 Sure . No problem . 
 Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? 	 Sure . Do you have my number ? 
 Sure . Do you have my number ? 	 Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . 
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 	 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 	 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 	 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? 	 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . 
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? 	 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . 
 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? 	 It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . 
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? 	 Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . 
 How much do you think it would cost ? 	 Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . 
 Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? 	 No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . 
 No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? 	 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . 
 Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 	 Certainly . 
 What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? 	 If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? 
 If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? 	 Yes . 
Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? 	 China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation 
 Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? 	 It depends on how much you order 
 Can I use the FAS terms ? 	 I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . 
Do you think I should turn down his offer ? 	 Yes , it's the correct thing to do . 
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? 	 Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . 
 Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? 	 Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . 
 Excuse me ? 	 Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . 
 What kind of change , just in prices ? 	 No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . 
 You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? 	 No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . 
Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? 	 We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? 	 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . 
 To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? 	 I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . 
Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? 	 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? 
 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? 	 Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? 
 Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? 	 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 	 We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . 
 I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? 	 Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . 
 Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? 	 It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? 
 It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? 	 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? 
 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? 	 Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . 
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? 	 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . 
 Carton ? 	 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 	 Why use wooden cases ? 
 Why use wooden cases ? 	 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . 
 You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? 	 That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . 
 No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? 	 Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . 
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? 	 Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . 
 Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? 	 Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? 	 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 	 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 	 Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . 
 By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? 	 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . 
 Good , what about the export packing ? 	 Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . 
 I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? 	 Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . 
 Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? 	 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . 
 Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? 	 All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . 
 Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? 	 Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . 
 Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? 	 I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . 
 In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? 	 Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . 
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? 	 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . 
 What about the outer packing ? 	 We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Cartons ? 	 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 	 Why use wooden cases ? 
 Why use wooden cases ? 	 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . 
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? 	 I don't think we can . 
 Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? 	 By the middle of October , I think . 
 Like what ? 	 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 	 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 	 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 
 And that is ? 	 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 	 I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . 
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? 	 Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . 
 It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? 	 We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . 
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 	 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 	 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? 	 I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . 
 In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? 	 It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . 
 Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? 	 If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .

Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 	 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 	 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 	 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 	 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 	 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 	 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? 	 For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . 
 That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? 	 Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? 
 Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? 	 Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? 
 Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? 	 For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . 
 We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? 	 I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . 
What separates your product from the competition ? 	 Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . 
 Is the software user-friendly ? 	 Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . 
 Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? 	 Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs . 
What are your terms of payment ? 	 Our terms are net 30 .

 what ’ s wrong , Jim ? 	 I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! 
 Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? 	 yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . 
 Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? 	 I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . 
 Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? 	 Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! 
Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? 	 You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . 
I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? 	 Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . 
 And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? 	 Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . 
 Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? 	 As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . 
I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? 	 Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents . 
 I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ? 	 Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .

 Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? 	 I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . 
 Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? 	 Not today . 
 What do you mean ? 	 I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . 
 Why ? 	 Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . 
 Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? 	 I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . 
 Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? 	 So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . 
 Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ? 	 Sure ? 
 Sure ? 	 Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . 
 You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? 	 Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t 
 Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? 	 Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .

 No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? 	 No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . 
 I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? 	 Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? 
 Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? 	 I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient .

 What would you like to know ? 	 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? 
 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? 	 Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . 
 What are bar vouchers ? 	 Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . 
 So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? 	 Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . 
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? 	 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 
 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 	 Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . 
 So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? 	 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 
 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 	 I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion

Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? 	 We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . 
 What ’ s the result ? 	 We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . 
 Why is that ? 	 It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . 
 Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? 	 Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . 
 Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? 	 A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs 
 Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? 	 A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . 
 What are you basing this information on ? 	 First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . 
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? 	 I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . 
 Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? 	 Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . 
 That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? 	 I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget 
 Does this title come with an increase in salary ? 	 Yes , it does . 
 Can you give me the specifics ? 	 Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 .

 Is there anything wrong ? 	 We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . 
 It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 	 Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally

 yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 	 yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 
 yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 	 yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction .

 yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? 	 the maximum is $ 1000 . 
 is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 	 yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards .

May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? 	 Yes . 
 Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? 	 Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . 
 Why not ? 	 Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . 
 Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? 	 Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . 
 Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? 	 Are you going to make an offer today ? 
 Are you going to make an offer today ? 	 Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates .
